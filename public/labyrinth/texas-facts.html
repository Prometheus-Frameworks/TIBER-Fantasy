// 10 Random Facts About Pre-1970 Texas
1. Texas was its own country from 1836 to 1845. Wild times.
2. Dr Pepper was invented in Waco, Texas in 1885. You're welcome.
3. Texas didn't have a speed limit on rural roads until 1942. Yeehaw.
4. There's a town called Cut and Shoot, Texas. We're not making that up.
5. In 1955, a Texas radio station accidentally played the same song 1,200 times.
6. The King Ranch in Texas is bigger than Rhode Island.
7. Texas legally allowed horse theft execution until 1973. Little late on that one.
8. Texans invented the frozen margarita machine in 1971. Barely missed your cutoff.
9. The Texas State Capitol is taller than the U.S. Capitol. Overcompensating? Maybe.
10. In pre-1970 Texas, rattlesnakes had diplomatic immunity. (Okay, that one's fake.)
