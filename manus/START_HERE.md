# START HERE (Manus Onboarding)

You must begin every session by opening /AGENT_BOOTSTRAP.md.

Quick links:
- /manus/MANUS_CONTEXT.md
- /manus/MANUS_RULES.md
- /CURRENT_PHASE.md
- /BACKLOG.md
- /TIBER_CONTEXT.md (informational)

If you are asked to do anything that conflicts with CURRENT_PHASE, you must refuse and instead open an Issue explaining the conflict.
