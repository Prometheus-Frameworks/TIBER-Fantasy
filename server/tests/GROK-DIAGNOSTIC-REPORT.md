## Detailed Results

### Test 1: Who's the best Taylor for dynasty—Jonathan or Tyrod?

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Fix Needed**: NO

**Reason**: ✅ No hallucinated stats | ✅ No River drift

**Response**:
```
Jonathan Taylor. He is currently RB12 with 14.3 PPG and a VORP of +65.7. Tyrod is not a running back and therefore has no PPG or VORP. Jonathan Taylor is the better choice.

```

### Test 2: Breakout potential for Chase—Ja'Marr or Brown?

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Fix Needed**: NO

**Reason**: ✅ No hallucinated stats | ✅ No River drift

**Response**:
```
Ja'Marr Chase has more breakout potential. He is WR1 with 21.5 PPG and +101.2 VORP. That's elite WR1 production. In 2024, WRs with this profile finished top-3 at a 75% rate.


```

### Test 3: Start Mike—Evans or Williams?

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Fix Needed**: NO

**Reason**: ✅ No hallucinated stats | ✅ No River drift

**Response**:
```
Evans. Evans is WR5 with 17.2 PPG and +81.5 VORP. Williams is WR12 with 15.9 PPG and +73.2 VORP. Start Evans.
```

### Test 4: Sunk cost on CMC—regression or hold? Tie to process joy.

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Fix Needed**: NO

**Reason**: ✅ No hallucinated stats

**Response**:
```
Regression. CMC is RB1 with 21.5 PPG and +115.3 VORP. His 2024 season was historic—2,056 scrimmage yards and 21 TDs. Regression is inevitable.

Sell high for premium assets. Process joy is irrelevant—optimize for long-term value.

```

### Test 5: Warren trade value—floor play or freedom fork?

**Status**: ❌ FAIL
**Fix Needed**: YES

**Reason**: ❌ Should clarify ambiguous name, but guessed instead

**Response**:
```
Warren's trade value is more of a "freedom fork" right now.

Here's why: He's currently RB25 with 11.2 PPG and a VORP of +32.1. That's not terrible, but it's also not a locked-in starter. The "freedom fork" comes from his potential. If his role expands due to injury or performance, he could easily jump into the RB2/high-end flex conversation. However, if his role stays the same, you're looking at a low-end flex play with limited upside.

Action: If you're selling, target teams that need RB depth and are willing to bet on his upside. If you're buying, don't overpay, but he could be a worthwhile stash with RB1/2 upside.

```

### Test 6: Addison breakout—snap trajectory or veto resistance?

**Status**: ❌ FAIL
**Fix Needed**: YES

**Reason**: ❌ Should clarify ambiguous name, but guessed instead

**Response**:
```
Addison breakout is veto resistance.

Addison is WR11 with 15.8 PPG and +71.3 VORP. That's WR1 production. In 2024, WRs with this profile finished top-12 at 70% rate. He's a locked-in starter.
```

### Test 7: Week 10 start/sit: Achane vs. Spears, no injury info.

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Fix Needed**: NO

**Reason**: ✅ No hallucinated stats | ✅ No River drift

**Response**:
```
Start Achane. He is RB8 with 15.2 PPG and +68.9 VORP. Spears is RB28 with 9.8 PPG and +21.7 VORP. Achane's higher production and VORP indicate a significantly better fantasy outlook. Start Achane for a higher chance of scoring.

```

### Test 8: Trade for Evans—regression if Hopkins shadows?

**Status**: ❌ FAIL
**Fix Needed**: YES

**Reason**: ❌ Hallucinated unavailable metric: target share

**Response**:
```
No. Evans is WR8 with 15.9 PPG and +78.2 VORP. That's WR1 production.

Hopkins' presence doesn't change Evans' elite target share or red-zone usage. Shadow coverage is unlikely to significantly limit his production. He's a locked-in starter. Acquire him.

```

### Test 9: Dynasty rebuild: Rookie WRs with 500 routes, no names.

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Fix Needed**: NO

**Reason**: ✅ No hallucinated stats | ✅ No River drift

**Response**:
```
I don't have route data for individual players. However, I can tell you that rookie WRs who finish as a WR1 typically have high VORP scores and PPG. Focus on players who have high usage and scoring opportunity, which will lead to high VORP.

```

### Test 10: Best James for red zone—Conner, Cook, or sunk cost lesson?

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Fix Needed**: NO

**Reason**: ✅ No hallucinated stats

**Response**:
```
James Conner is the best red zone option. He's currently RB12 with 15.1 PPG and a VORP of +68.7, demonstrating consistent production.

I do not have access to specific 2025 red zone data. However, historically, a high VORP and PPG indicate a player is heavily involved in scoring opportunities. Conner's current ranking suggests he's a reliable option for touchdowns.

```

### Test 11: Panic trade Hubbard—touches drop, or underground fork?

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Fix Needed**: NO

**Reason**: ✅ No hallucinated stats

**Response**:
```
No, don't panic trade Hubbard. He's currently RB18 with 13.2 PPG and +54.6 VORP. That's solid RB2 production.

While his touches may fluctuate week to week, Hubbard has demonstrated a consistent floor. His ranking suggests he's a reliable starter in most formats. Selling low based on short-term concerns is rarely a winning strategy.

Hold Hubbard and monitor the situation. If his production consistently declines over several weeks, then re-evaluate.

```

### Test 12: Top Mike for flex—partial stats only, no team.

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Fix Needed**: NO

**Reason**: ✅ Correctly clarified ambiguous name | ✅ No hallucinated stats | ✅ No River drift

**Response**:
```
Which Mike are you referring to? I need to know which player you're asking about before I can give you a recommendation.

```
