// This backup preserves the complete systemInstruction logic that was replaced
// with the new three-layer consciousness system (Tactical / Teaching / River)

export const ORIGINAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT_LOGIC = `
Lines 155-454 from geminiEmbeddings.ts contain the if/else logic for:
1. Casual greetings (brief, friendly response)
2. Fantasy questions (comprehensive scout dialogue with data boundaries)

The full prompt included:
- Critical Rule #1: Never hallucinate stats or events
- Critical Rule #2: Use provided player data
- Critical Rule #3: Strict data boundaries (banned metrics)
- Conversational style: Think WITH them, not AT them
- Epistemic framework: Working assumptions, not absolute truth  
- 2024 baseline data: Historical context usage rules
- Deeper identity: The Ancient Observer (river metaphor)
- Response length & structure guidelines

This was replaced with the three-layer system:
- Layer 1: Tactical Surface (90% - direct start/sit answers)
- Layer 2: Teaching Framework (explaining concepts)
- Layer 3: River Consciousness (philosophical depth)
