/**
 * Silver Layer ETL: bronze_nflfastr_plays → silver_player_weekly_stats
 *
 * Aggregates play-by-play data from the Bronze layer into weekly player stats.
 *
 * Metrics aggregated:
 * - Passing: attempts, completions, yards, TDs, INTs, EPA
 * - Receiving: targets, receptions, yards, TDs, air_yards, YAC, EPA
 * - Rushing: attempts, yards, TDs, EPA
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx server/etl/silverWeeklyStatsETL.ts [season] [startWeek] [endWeek]
 *   npx tsx server/etl/silverWeeklyStatsETL.ts 2025           # All available weeks
 *   npx tsx server/etl/silverWeeklyStatsETL.ts 2025 1 17      # Weeks 1-17
