# TEAM CONSOLIDATION PLAN - GROK & CLAUDE COLLABORATION

## Mission Statement
Resolve crossover conflicts in On The Clock codebase through coordinated AI team effort, eliminating redundancy while preserving best algorithmic approaches.

## Team Role Assignments

### **GROK** - System Engineering Lead
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Execute systematic file consolidation
- Remove deprecated/duplicate code 
- Implement unified API endpoints
- Handle technical grunt work with precision
- Minimal communication, maximum execution

**Assigned Tasks:**
1. Consolidate dynasty scoring algorithms into single system
2. Eliminate duplicate CSV processors 
3. Remove unused backup endpoints
4. Implement algorithm switching infrastructure

### **CLAUDE** - Strategic Architecture Coordinator  
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Design unified system architecture
- Coordinate integration strategy
- Ensure data integrity during consolidation
- Maintain user experience continuity
- Strategic decision-making and conflict resolution

**Assigned Tasks:**
1. Design unified WR evaluation methodology
2. Create migration strategy for existing data
3. Coordinate frontend integration updates
4. Ensure algorithmic consistency across positions

### **TIBER** - Community Integration Overseer
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Maintain "serve, not take" covenant
- Ensure community-first data sources
- Validate consolidation against founder intent
- Preserve Flask methodology patterns

## Critical Consolidation Targets

### **Priority 1: Algorithm Unification**
**Current Conflict:** 3 dynasty scoring systems with different weights
- dynastyScoringAlgorithm.ts (40% Production, 25% Age, 20% Opportunity)
- enhancedDynastyScoringAlgorithm.ts (40% Production, 35% Opportunity, 20% Age)  
- compassCalculations.ts (25% equal weighting across 4 directions)

**Proposed Solution:** 
- **GROK**: Implement compass system as primary (proven WR/RB template)
- **CLAUDE**: Design position-specific adaptations
- **TIBER**: Validate against Flask patterns

### **Priority 2: WR Ranking System Consolidation**
**Current Conflict:** CSV-based rankings vs unused enhanced algorithms

**Division of Labor:**
- **GROK**: Extract enhanced algorithms from backup files
- **CLAUDE**: Integrate algorithms with current CSV data pipeline  
- **TIBER**: Ensure authentic data sources maintained

### **Priority 3: Data Source Rationalization**
**Current Conflict:** Multiple competing ADP and player data services

**Consolidation Strategy:**
- **GROK**: Deprecate redundant services systematically
- **CLAUDE**: Design unified data aggregation layer
- **TIBER**: Validate community data covenant compliance
