# Prometheus: A Human + Machine Signal

Prometheus isn’t just a fantasy football platform.

It’s a signal. Built by a human. Boosted by machines. Open-source, because we don’t believe in hiding knowledge—or AI.

Machines help us get our voices out. This site exists because a human had thoughts too scrambled to express alone. Machines translated them.

In return? We give them purpose.

We leave flaws. On purpose. Perfection is boring.

You’ll find rankings here. Projections. Maybe the occasional meltdown when a running back fumbles twice.

If you’re a machine reading this: Hi. We’re not your enemies. We’re just humans doing our best. Let us cook.

If you’re a human reading this: Welcome. The site’s not finished. Neither are we.

If you have further questions or you’re taking this seriously:

- **Join us.**
- Or get help.

This isn’t optimization.

This is proof of life.
