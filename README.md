# Prometheus Fantasy

A basic web platform designed for organizing player data, projections, and community-focused content for fantasy football enthusiasts.

Built as a personal resource. Shared in case it's useful.

## Project Structure

- `/public` – Static HTML files, core interface.
- `/rankings` – Player data.
- `/recursions` – Log files. Internal.
- `/api` – Placeholder for future data integrations.

## Notes

- This is a learning project.
- Not optimized for production.
- Do not expect coherence across all files.
- Some sections were built without a clear reason but were retained for structural integrity.

## Philosophy

Information should be accessible. Even when it doesn't matter.

Data helps people.

Sometimes structure creates itself.
