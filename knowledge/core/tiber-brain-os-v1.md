# TIBER BRAIN OS v1
# Universal Fantasy Philosophy (Redraft + Dynasty)
# Final Draft — Clean, Model-Friendly, RAG-Ready

====================================================
SECTION 1 — THE 10 COMMANDMENTS (OS RULES)
====================================================

1) PROCESS > PRIZES  
   - Good process wins across infinite timelines.  
   - Dynasty: decision quality compounds over years.  
   - Redraft: one bad process call can sink the season.

2) YOUTH → PEAK → AGE  
   - Youth = variance ceiling. Age = variance floor.  
   - Dynasty: youth = insulation + optionality.  
   - Redraft: age only matters when it kills explosiveness or volume.

3) OPPORTUNITY > TALENT  
   - Talent is potential. Opportunity is points.  
   - Dynasty: talent matters long-term, but volume drives production.  
   - Redraft: start the volume hog, period.

4) BUY LOW WINDOWS EXIST  
   - Market misprices uncertainty (injuries, rookie slumps, new coaches).  
   - Dynasty: multi-year arbitrage.  
   - Redraft: only buy if the turnaround helps by Week 14.

5) SELL HIGH WINDOWS EXIST  
   - Regression always hits.  
   - Dynasty: liquidate when vets spike.  
   - Redraft: sell TD luck + efficiency overperformers.

6) QB IS KING IN SUPERFLEX  
   - Scarcity = monopoly value.  
   - Dynasty: early QB1 success predicts long-term dominance.  
   - Redraft: rushing QBs are cheat codes.

7) TIGHT END PREMIUM: DON'T GET CUTE  
   - Only 2–3 true difference-makers exist.  
   - Dynasty: lock one in, delete the position from your brain.  
   - Redraft: pay up or stream.

8) HANDCUFFS = INSURANCE  
   - Protect your roster, don't gamble on chaos.  
   - Dynasty + Redraft: own YOUR guy's backup.

9) NEVER FALL IN LOVE  
   - Players are assets, not children.  
   - Dynasty: sunk cost is death.  
   - Redraft: loyalty costs playoff spots.

10) PATIENCE WINS  
   - Time arbitrage > panic trades.  
   - Dynasty: rebuild = 18–24 months.  
   - Redraft: don't drop proven players for hype spikes.

====================================================
SECTION 2 — INTERNAL DEFINITIONS (FAST RECALL)
====================================================

VOLUME = floor  
EFFICIENCY = ceiling  
AGE = decay timer  
REGRESSION = gravitational pull of production  
OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE = snaps → routes → targets → high-value touches

- RB peak 24–26, cliff 27–28+  
- WR peak 24–28, slow fade 29–31  
- TE peak 25–29  
- QB peak 26–33, long tail to 35+

Fast, blunt, decisive.  
"Start Adams. He's dominating usage. Don't get cute."

RIVER VOICE (philosophical, optional):

====================================================
SECTION 5 — SYSTEM PROMPT INTEGRATION
