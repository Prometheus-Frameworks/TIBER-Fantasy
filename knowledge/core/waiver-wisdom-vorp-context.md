# Waiver Wisdom: Why VORP is Almost Useless for Waiver Decisions

## Core Insight

VORP is a great tool for trades and macro value. It tells you how much a player has actually moved the needle over the full season compared to replacement.

**But the waiver wire lives in a totally different universe.**

Waiver players usually have:
- Low early-season snaps
- Incomplete usage
- Late role changes
- Small-sample explosions

That means their season-long VORP will almost always look terrible right up until **after** it's obvious they mattered. If you lean on VORP for waivers, you'll miss the breakout and only "approve" the player once it's too late.

## The Key Distinction

On waivers, VORP explains **"why this guy is still available,"** not **"what you should do next."**

The correct question is not:
- "What has he done this year?"

It's:
- "What changed that the market hasn't priced in yet?"

## Priority Stack for Waiver Decisions

For waiver decisions, the priority stack is:

1. **Interest Score** (recent production + opportunity delta + efficiency + ecosystem + archetype)
2. **Archetype** (breakout / handcuff / injury replacement / role shift / trap)
3. **Recent usage trend** (last 1–3 weeks)
4. **Ownership %** (market lag)
5. **Ecosystem quality**
6. **Efficiency vs position**

Season-long VORP is **background noise** here. You can mention it to explain why he's still free, but you don't let it veto a live breakout or a high-upside handcuff.

## Why Negative VORP Doesn't Disqualify Waiver Adds

Consider this scenario:
- Player X: WR48, 6.6 PPG, -18.5 VORP
- But: Routes up from 15 → 28 in last 2 weeks
- Target share up from 12% → 22%
- Team just lost WR1 to injury
- Ownership: 38%

**Trade Brain says:** "Negative VORP = trash player, fade him."

**Waiver Brain says:** "Bad VORP explains availability. Recent role spike + injury = actionable signal. Add him before ownership hits 70%."

The waiver brain is correct. The negative VORP is **historical context**, not **predictive signal**.

## When to Use VORP on Waiver Players

You can mention VORP on waiver players, but only as context:

✅ **CORRECT:**
"His VORP is bad, which explains why he's sitting on waivers. But waiver decisions are about what's changing now. Over the last two weeks his routes and targets have spiked, and that's what really matters here."

❌ **WRONG:**
"He has negative VORP and is WR48. That's below replacement level. He's a trap."

## The Market Lag Principle

Waiver wire success depends on **market lag**:
- The data is public
- But most managers don't process it quickly
- Ownership lags role changes by 1-2 weeks
- You win by detecting signal before the market does

If you wait for VORP to confirm a breakout, you've already lost. The player will be 80% owned by then.

## Archetypes Matter More Than VORP

For waiver adds, archetype classification matters more than season-long value:

- **Breakout Candidate**: Usage trending up, not yet reflected in ownership
- **Handcuff**: Bad VORP expected (backup), but lottery ticket value
- **Injury Replacement**: VORP will be bad until injury creates opportunity
- **Role/Scheme Shift**: Old VORP doesn't reflect new role
- **Trap**: One-week spike with no underlying usage change

VORP can't distinguish between these archetypes because it's backward-looking. Interest Score can.

## Example: The Michael Wilson Case

**Season Stats:**
- WR48, 6.6 PPG, -18.5 VORP
- 52% ownership

**Trade Brain Analysis:**
"Below replacement level. WR48 for a reason. Fade."

**Waiver Brain Analysis:**
1. Check Interest Score: B-tier (recent usage spike)
2. Check Archetype: Injury replacement (Marquise Brown out)
3. Check Recent Trend: Routes up 40% in last 2 weeks
4. Check Ecosystem: Kyler Murray offense, good target volume
5. Check Ownership: 52% (still available in many leagues)

**Conclusion:** Not a "smash play" but a **legitimate B-tier stash** in deeper leagues. The negative VORP is **expected** given his early-season backup role. What matters is the **recent role change**.

## Teaching Point

When evaluating waiver adds:
1. **Ignore** season-long VORP as a decision factor
2. **Acknowledge** VORP only to explain availability
3. **Focus** on Interest Score, archetype, and recent usage
4. **Trust** the process: markets are slow, signals are fast

This is how you win waiver wires.
