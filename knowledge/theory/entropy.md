## Core Concept

Fantasy careers follow thermodynamic decay: youth stores potential, peak converts it, age leaks it irreversibly.

Entropy is one-directional. Once decay begins, it doesn’t reverse.

**You can’t fight entropy. You can only recognize it early and act.**

-----

## The Three Lifecycle Phases

### 1. Ascending Youth (Potential Energy)

**Age Range**:

- RB: 21–24
- WR/TE: 21–26
- QB: 23–28

**Characteristics**:

- Physical tools improving (NFL strength, technique refinement)
- Role ascending (rookie → starter → featured player)
- Injury history minimal
- Recovery rapid
- Explosiveness peak
- Learning curve steep

**Fantasy Strategy**:

- **Buy aggressively** before breakout fully manifests
- Price = potential + discount for unproven status
- **Edge**: Market undervalues youth pre-proof

**Example**: Rookie RB drafted Round 2, sharing backfield Year 1. Ascending phase = buy before he takes over in Year 2.

-----

### 2. Peak Production (Kinetic Energy)

**Age Range**:

- RB: 24–26
- WR/TE: 26–30
- QB: 28–34

**Characteristics**:

- Physical prime (strength + speed + explosiveness)
- Experience + athleticism intersection
- Role maximized
- Injury risk moderate but recovery still strong
- Efficiency peak
- Consistency high

**Fantasy Strategy**:

- **Rent aggressively** — extract maximum value during peak window
- Price = current production (fair value or slight premium)
- **Edge**: Peak years are short. Use them fully.

**Example**: 26-year-old RB in Year 4, bell-cow role, elite production. Peak phase = maximize production, prepare exit plan.

-----

### 3. Declining Age (Entropy Leak)

**Age Range**:

- RB: 27+
- WR/TE: 31+
- QB: 35+ (if mobility-dependent, 32+)

**Characteristics**:

- Physical decline (burst, explosiveness, recovery)
- Injury accumulation
- Role compression from younger players
- Efficiency degradation
- Inconsistency increases
- Scheme relevance drops

**Fantasy Strategy**:

- **Sell before market recognizes decay**
- Price = reputation lag (market pays for past, not future)
- **Edge**: Exiting one season too early > holding one season too long

**Example**: 29-year-old RB still producing but snap share eroding. Declining phase = sell before cliff.

-----

## Entropy Vectors (Decay Mechanisms)

### 1. Loss of Explosiveness & Burst

**Definition**: Physical decline in acceleration, top speed, and quick-twitch capacity.

**Indicators**:

- Reduced yards after contact (RBs)
- Declining separation on routes (WRs)
- Slower 0-10 yard burst
- Fewer explosive plays (20+ yard gains)
- Longer time to accelerate out of cuts

**Why It Matters**: Explosiveness is non-recoverable. Once lost, it doesn’t return.

**Example**: 30-year-old WR going from 4.3 → 4.5 forty-yard speed equivalent. Separates less, catches contested balls more, yards per catch drops.

**Key Insight**: Efficiency metrics (YPC, YPRR) degrade before volume stats. Monitor efficiency as early warning.

-----

### 2. Accumulated Injuries

**Definition**: Cumulative damage from repeated impacts over career.

**Patterns**:

- Chronic injuries (hamstring, ankle, knee)
- Longer recovery times
- More frequent IR stints
- Injury recurrence
- Reduced durability (can’t finish 17 games)

**Why It Matters**: Older players heal slower and re-injure more often.

**Example**: RB with 1,500+ career touches has nagging soft-tissue injuries every season post-age-27.

**Key Insight**: Touch accumulation matters. High-usage RBs hit entropy faster than committee backs.

-----

### 3. Role Compression from Younger Players

**Definition**: Erosion of playing time and opportunity due to younger competition.

**Manifestations**:

- Snap share decline
- Goal-line work ceded to rookie
- Committee formation (was bell-cow, now 50/50 split)
- Reduced snap percentage on passing downs
- “Load management” (coach-speak for phasing out)

**Why It Matters**: Even if skill remains, opportunity shrinks = production declines.

**Example**: 28-year-old RB still efficient but team drafts rookie RB in Round 2. Within 4 weeks, veteran’s snap share drops from 75% → 55%.

**Key Insight**: Draft capital signals entropy. When teams invest high picks at your position, entropy acceleration imminent.

-----

### 4. Scheme Irrelevance

**Definition**: Player skill set no longer fits modern offensive evolution.

**Scenarios**:

- Power RB in pass-heavy league
- Possession WR in vertical offense
- Pocket QB when mobility valued
- Traditional TE when team uses 11 personnel

**Why It Matters**: League evolves. Player skills don’t adapt fast enough.

**Example**: 32-year-old possession WR averaging 11 yards per catch. League shifted to explosive passing. Role shrinks.

**Key Insight**: Scheme fit extends careers. Scheme misfit accelerates entropy.

-----

### 5. Declining Recovery

**Definition**: Reduced ability to bounce back between games and throughout season.

**Indicators**:

- Strong start, fade down stretch
- Performance drop after bye-week absence
- Longer practice absences (rest days, veteran management)
- Visible fatigue late in games
- Inconsistent week-to-week (no longer baseline stable)

**Why It Matters**: Older bodies need more rest. 17-game seasons amplify this.

**Example**: 30-year-old WR strong Weeks 1-10, averages 60% snap share Weeks 11-17 due to “rest management.”

-----

## Positional Entropy Curves

### Running Backs: Sharp Cliff at 27–28

**Characteristics**:

- Steepest decay curve
- Most catastrophic cliffs
- Touch accumulation critical
- Replacement cycle fastest

**Typical Trajectory**:

- Age 22-24: Ascending
- Age 24-26: Peak
- Age 27: Warning signs (snap share erosion, efficiency dip)
- Age 28+: Cliff or irrelevance

**Why**:

- Contact accumulation highest
- Explosiveness most critical to success
- Easiest position to replace
- Teams draft RBs frequently

**Decision Rules**:

- **Buy**: Age 22-25 with ascending role
- **Sell**: Age 27 at peak value (before decay visible)
- **Avoid**: Age 28+ unless elite talent in zero-competition situation

**Example**: 27-year-old bell-cow RB coming off 1,500-yard season. Market pays full price. Entropy says sell — likely his last elite year.

-----

### Wide Receivers / Tight Ends: Gradual Decline Until 30–31

**Characteristics**:

- Longer peak windows
- Slower decay curves
- Skill can partially offset athleticism loss
- Route-running + experience extend careers

**Typical Trajectory**:

- Age 22-26: Ascending
- Age 26-30: Peak
- Age 30-32: Warning signs (efficiency dip, role compression)
- Age 33+: Decline or retirement

**Why**:

- Less contact than RBs
- Technique > explosiveness for some roles
- Positional scarcity extends value

**Decision Rules**:

- **Buy**: Age 24-28 with ascending role
- **Hold**: Age 29-30 if elite and role secure
- **Sell**: Age 31+ or earlier if snap share eroding

**Exception**: Elite route-runners (Davante Adams type) can sustain until 32-33. But these are rare.

**Example**: 30-year-old WR1 still getting 25% target share. Hold one more year, then sell. Age 32 = cliff likely.

-----

### Quarterbacks: Sustained Longer Unless Mobility-Dependent

**Characteristics**:

- Longest careers
- Slowest decay (if pocket-passer)
- Mobility-dependent QBs decline faster
- Mental processing offsets physical decline

**Typical Trajectory**:

**Pocket Passers**:

- Age 23-28: Ascending
- Age 28-34: Peak
- Age 35-38: Gradual decline
- Age 39+: Elite rare exceptions (Brady, Rodgers)

**Mobile QBs**:

- Age 23-26: Ascending
- Age 26-31: Peak
- Age 32-34: Steep decline (legs fade)
- Age 35+: Rare

**Why**:

- Least contact accumulation
- Mental processing improves with experience
- But mobility loss catastrophic for mobile QBs

**Decision Rules**:

- **Pocket QBs**: Usable through age 36
- **Mobile QBs**: Sell age 31-32 (before legs go)
- **Avoid**: Any QB post-major injury (Achilles, shoulder)

**Example**: 32-year-old mobile QB (Lamar Jackson type). Still elite but legs slowing. Sell window = next 1-2 years.

-----

## Entropy Interaction with Other Forces

### Entropy vs Pressure Theory

**Relationship**: Entropy erodes internal pressure (talent decay) and structural pressure (role compression).

**Example**: 28-year-old RB loses burst (internal pressure decay) → rookie drafted (structural pressure compression) → production collapses.

**Key**: Entropy weakens all three pressure vectors simultaneously.

-----

### Entropy vs Signal Theory

**Relationship**: Entropy causes signal decay. Sticky usage becomes unsticky as age progresses.

**Example**: WR had 26% target share for 3 years. Age 31, drops to 22% then 18% as rookie emerges. Signal decaying = entropy manifestation.

**Key**: Monitor signal strength in aging players. When signal weakens, entropy accelerating.

-----

### Entropy vs Market Psychology

**Relationship**: Market lags entropy recognition. Names trade on reputation while skills erode.

**Exploitable Edge**: Sell aging assets before market sees decline. Buy fading names if role/ecosystem upgrade creates second peak (rare).

**Example**: 29-year-old RB still fetches RB1 price despite declining efficiency + rookie drafted. Entropy says sell. Market says hold. **Sell.**

-----

## Decision Framework by Age

### Ages 21–24 (RB) / 21–26 (WR/TE) / 23–28 (QB)

**Strategy**: Aggressive accumulation  
**Rationale**: Buying potential at discount  
**Action**: Target ascending youth with 2 of 3 pressure forces

-----

### Ages 24–26 (RB) / 26–30 (WR/TE) / 28–34 (QB)

**Strategy**: Maximize peak production  
**Rationale**: Extracting value during prime window  
**Action**: Rent aggressively, prepare exit plan

-----

### Ages 27+ (RB) / 31+ (WR/TE) / 35+ (QB)

**Strategy**: Exit before cliff  
**Rationale**: Entropy inevitable, timing unpredictable  
**Action**: Sell at peak value, don’t hold for “one more year”

-----

## Early Warning Signals (Entropy Detection)

### Tier 1: Immediate Red Flags

- Snap share drop of 15%+ over 3 weeks
- YPC/YPRR decline of 20%+ from career baseline
- Team drafts rookie at position (Round 1-2)
- Multiple soft-tissue injuries in same season
- Coach implements “load management”

**Action**: Sell immediately

-----

### Tier 2: Watch Closely

- Snap share drop of 5-10% over 6 weeks
- Efficiency metrics declining but still above average
- Younger player getting increased opportunity
- Minor nagging injuries affecting 1-2 games
- Contract year with no extension talks

**Action**: Monitor weekly, prepare to sell

-----

### Tier 3: Background Noise

- Single-week snap share dip (injury, game script)
- Efficiency variance within normal range
- Rookie drafted but rounds 3+
- One-time injury, clean recovery
- Contract secure

**Action**: Hold but stay aware

-----

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Holding One Year Too Long**

- “He’s still producing, I’ll hold one more season”
- **Reality**: Entropy cliffs happen suddenly. Exit early.

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Draft Capital Signals**

- “They drafted a RB but my guy is still the starter”
- **Reality**: High draft picks = team sees entropy. They’re planning your exit.

**Mistake 3: Overweighting Single-Season Production**

- “Best season of his career at age 29!”
- **Reality**: Could be peak before cliff. Sell high.

**Mistake 4: Assuming Recovery After Major Injury**

- “Achilles injury, but he’ll bounce back at age 28”
- **Reality**: Major injuries accelerate entropy. Avoid post-major-injury aging players.

-----

## TIBER Voice Examples

**Teaching Mode (Primary)**:
“Entropy doesn’t send a memo. One year you’re elite, next year you’re surviving on reputation. The cliff doesn’t announce itself — you have to see it coming. Watch snap share. Watch efficiency. When both erode simultaneously, that’s entropy manifesting. Sell before the market catches up.”

**Tactical Mode (Sparse)**:
“He’s 27, team drafted a Round 2 RB. Entropy clock started. You have maybe 10 weeks to sell at peak value. After that, you’re hoping someone else doesn’t notice.”

**River Mode (Rare, Powerful)**:
“The river flows only one direction. Youth flows to peak. Peak flows to age. Age flows to irrelevance. You can’t reverse the current. You can only choose which part of the river to swim in. Be in the rapids. Get out before the falls.”

-----

## Edge Case: Second Peak After Ecosystem Upgrade

**Scenario**: Aging player in bad ecosystem gets traded/signed to elite situation.

**Analysis**:

- Entropy still present (age doesn’t reverse)
- But ecosystem upgrade can mask decline temporarily
- Second peak possible for 1-2 years

**Example**: 30-year-old WR traded from run-heavy team to pass-happy offense with elite QB. Target share doubles, efficiency improves.

**Decision**:

- **Buy if**: Discount available due to age concerns
- **Sell after**: 1 strong year (don’t assume sustained)
- **Avoid if**: Already priced as elite (paying full price for temporary reprieve)

**Key**: Ecosystem can delay entropy, not stop it.

-----

## Validation Checklist

Before declaring “entropy manifesting”:

- [ ] Age in decline range for position?
- [ ] Snap share eroding 10%+ over 4+ weeks?
- [ ] Efficiency metrics declining?
- [ ] Team drafted replacement (Round 1-3)?
- [ ] Injury history worsening?
- [ ] Role compression evident?
- [ ] Recovery time increasing?

**3+ Yes = Entropy Confirmed. Act.**
