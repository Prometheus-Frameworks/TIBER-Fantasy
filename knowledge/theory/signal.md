## Core Concept

Signal is any repeatable, coach-intentioned pattern that survives chaos.  
Noise is everything else.

Fantasy production contains both. Your edge is separating them.

**Signal persists. Noise reverts.**

-----

## Signal Characteristics

### 1. Stable Role Week-to-Week

**Definition**: Player assignment and usage remain consistent regardless of game outcome.

**Indicators**:

- Snap share variance < 10% across 3+ weeks
- Play-type consistency (same route tree, same down-and-distance usage)
- Personnel package stability (always on field in 11 personnel, etc.)
- Role survives blowouts, close games, and trailing scripts

**Example**: WR running 85–90% snaps every week regardless of score. That’s signal. WR fluctuating between 50–90% based on game script? Noise.

**Key Test**: Does usage hold in losing efforts? If volume disappears when trailing, it’s game-script dependent (noise), not role-based (signal).

-----

### 2. Sticky Usage Metrics

**Definition**: Volume targets or touches that persist across varying conditions.

**Sticky Metrics**:

- Target share (for WR/TE)
- Touch share (for RB)
- Route participation (WRs)
- Red-zone opportunity share
- High-leverage down usage (3rd downs, 2-minute drill)

**Unsticky Metrics**:

- Total targets (fluctuates with pace and pass attempts)
- Total yards (variance-prone)
- Touchdowns (random unless red-zone role sticky)

**Example**: WR maintaining 25–28% target share across 5 weeks = signal. Total targets varying 6-8-12-7-10 = noise, but if target share holds at 26%, that’s stable structure.

**Key Insight**: Share-based metrics filter out team-level variance (pace, game script, opponent). Absolute volume metrics don’t.

-----

### 3. Repeatable Efficiency

**Definition**: Performance per opportunity remains stable, indicating skill + scheme fit.

**Efficiency Signals**:

- Yards per route run (YPRR) staying above player baseline
- Yards per touch consistently above league average for role
- Success rate (% of touches gaining expected yards)
- Target quality (aDOT, catchable target rate)

**Efficiency Noise**:

- Single-game explosions (120 yards on 3 catches)
- Touchdown variance without red-zone role
- Yards After Catch on broken plays

**Example**: RB averaging 4.5+ yards per carry across 6 weeks = efficiency signal. RB with 2.8 YPC then one 150-yard game = noise spike.

**Key Test**: Remove outlier games. Does efficiency baseline hold? If yes, signal. If no, variance.

-----

### 4. Consistent Deployment Regardless of Score

**Definition**: Usage doesn’t collapse in negative game scripts or explode in garbage time.

**Signal Deployment**:

- Player stays on field when losing
- Usage in competitive situations (not just blowouts)
- Involvement in key drives (2-minute drill, goal-line)
- Coach trust signals (targets in tight windows, usage on 3rd-and-long)

**Noise Deployment**:

- Volume spike only in blowout wins (prevent defense)
- Disappears when trailing (game-script dependent)
- Garbage-time padding
- Situational replacement (3rd-down back who never sees 1st/2nd down)

**Example**: Pass-catching RB getting 6–8 targets per game in close contests + when trailing = signal. RB only used when up 20+ in 4th quarter = noise.

-----

## Noise Characteristics

### 1. Random Touchdowns

**Definition**: Scoring without red-zone role or target concentration.

**Indicators**:

- Long TDs from broken plays
- Touchdown rate far exceeding touch/target share
- No red-zone opportunity consistency
- Touchdown clustering (3 TDs one week, zero the next 4 weeks)

**Example**: WR3 scoring on 70-yard busted coverage but averaging 3 targets per game with zero red-zone looks. TD is noise.

**Key Insight**: Touchdowns are the noisiest fantasy stat. Requires red-zone role + target/touch share to become signal.

-----

### 2. Garbage-Time Volume

**Definition**: Production accumulation in non-competitive game situations.

**Indicators**:

- Stats spike only in 4th quarter of blowouts
- Volume disappears in close games
- Efficiency craters in competitive situations
- Prevent defense allows easy yards

**Example**: WR getting 8 targets in final 10 minutes down 28 points against soft zone. Volume is noise, not structural role.

**Key Test**: Remove garbage time (score differential > 14 in 4th quarter). Does production hold? If no, it’s noise.

-----

### 3. One-Game Weather Anomalies

**Definition**: Environmental conditions creating temporary usage spikes.

**Scenarios**:

- Heavy wind games forcing run-heavy scripts
- Rain/snow games limiting passing
- Extreme heat causing rotation changes
- Indoor/outdoor dome variance

**Example**: RB getting 30 touches in blizzard game when team usually passes. Extreme weather = noise unless usage pattern repeats.

**Key Insight**: Single-game environmental spikes don’t predict future unless the environmental condition persists.

-----

### 4. Temporary Teammate Injuries

**Definition**: Volume spike due to short-term absence of depth-chart competition.

**Indicators**:

- Usage increase only while teammate injured
- Volume immediately shrinks when teammate returns
- No permanent role elevation
- Coach statements confirm temporary fill-in

**Example**: WR2 getting 10 targets per game while WR1 injured, drops to 5 targets when WR1 returns. Temporary spike = noise.

**Key Test**: Did role persist after teammate returned? If no, it was replacement volume, not structural change.

-----

## Signal vs Noise Decision Framework

### Three-Week Rule

**Principle**: Require three consecutive weeks before treating a pattern as signal.

**Rationale**:

- Week 1 = could be variance
- Week 2 = could be coincidence
- Week 3+ = pattern confirmation

**Application**:

- WR gets 25% target share Week 8: Interesting, not actionable
- WR gets 25% target share Week 8, 9: Noteworthy, watch closely
- WR gets 25% target share Week 8, 9, 10: **Signal confirmed, act**

**Exception**: Structural changes (injury, trade, depth chart promotion) can create instant signal if role clarity immediate. Still confirm with usage data Week 2+.

-----

### Discount Single-Game Explosions Unless Role Confirms

**Principle**: Spike games are noise until role structure validates them.

**Decision Tree**:

**Scenario 1: Big game + role elevation**

- 120 yards on 10 targets (high target share)
- Snap share 85%+ (structural)
- **Analysis**: Explosion validates role. Signal.

**Scenario 2: Big game + no role change**

- 120 yards on 3 targets (long TDs)
- Snap share 55% (no elevation)
- **Analysis**: Explosion is variance. Noise.

**Example**: Rookie WR goes 8/140/2 on 12 targets in Week 5. Check: Was he on field 80%+ snaps? Did target share hold Week 6+? If yes, signal. If no, outlier game.

-----

### Prioritize Sticky Usage Over Flashy Box Scores

**Principle**: Volume share predicts future production better than total stats.

**Why**:

- Box scores are outcome metrics (variance-prone)
- Usage shares are process metrics (sticky)
- Coaches control usage, not outcomes

**Comparison**:

**Player A**: 5 rec, 48 yards, 0 TD on 25% target share, 88% snaps  
**Player B**: 7 rec, 102 yards, 2 TD on 18% target share, 62% snaps

**Analysis**: Player A has signal (sticky usage). Player B has noise (flashy outcome without structural support).

**Prediction**: Player A outscores Player B over next 6 weeks.

-----

## Signal Confirmation Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Candidate Pattern

- Volume spike, role change, or efficiency baseline shift
- Note the week it began

### Step 2: Check Structural Support

- Snap share elevated?
- Target/touch share increased?
- Role clarity evident?

### Step 3: Test for Noise Factors

- Garbage time?
- Opponent prevent defense?
- Temporary injury replacement?
- Weather anomaly?

### Step 4: Apply Three-Week Rule

- Does pattern persist Week 2?
- Does pattern persist Week 3?
- If yes to both, declare signal

### Step 5: Monitor for Decay

- Does signal weaken over time?
- Role compression from competition?
- Efficiency degradation?

-----

## Edge Cases & Nuance

### When Signal Conflicts with Low Efficiency

**Scenario**: Player has structural signal (high snap share, target share) but efficiency is poor.

**Analysis**:

- Signal = role is real
- Low efficiency = talent or scheme-fit question
- **Outcome depends on**: Is efficiency improving? Is role shrinking?

**Decision**:

- **Improving efficiency + stable role**: Buy, signal strengthening
- **Declining efficiency + stable role**: Hold, monitor for role compression
- **Declining efficiency + eroding role**: Sell, signal decaying

**Example**: WR getting 25% target share but only 6 yards per target. If next 2 weeks show 7.5, then 8.5 YPRR, efficiency catching up = buy. If YPRR stays 6 or drops, role at risk.

-----

### When Short-Term Noise Creates Long-Term Signal

**Scenario**: Temporary injury replacement performs so well, he keeps the role permanently.

**Analysis**:

- Initial spike = noise (injury replacement)
- Strong performance = internal pressure (talent validation)
- Permanent role = signal (structural change confirmed)

**Example**: Backup RB fills in for 3 weeks due to injury, averages 5.2 YPC and 100 scrimmage yards. Starter returns but backup now gets 50% of touches going forward. Noise became signal.

**Key**: Watch for coach statements, snap share when starter returns. If backup maintains 40%+ touches, it’s signal now.

-----

### When Signal Appears but Ecosystem is Broken

**Scenario**: Player has sticky usage (signal) but team offense collapses (ecosystem failure).

**Analysis**:

- Signal = role is real
- Ecosystem = environment limits ceiling
- **Outcome**: Signal without payoff

**Example**: WR maintaining 28% target share on team that passes only 25 times per game. Signal exists (role), but ecosystem caps production at ~7 targets/game.

**Decision**: Recognize signal but downgrade projection based on ecosystem constraints. (See Ecosystem Theory Module for interaction.)

-----

## Signal Theory vs Other Frameworks (Non-Overlap Validation)

**Signal ≠ Pressure**:

- Pressure = forces causing breakout
- Signal = confirmation that breakout is sustainable
- Example: Pressure explains why WR gets the role. Signal confirms he keeps it.

**Signal ≠ Market Psychology**:

- Signal = objective usage patterns
- Market Psychology = crowd perception
- Example: Signal identifies the sustainable player. Market Psychology determines if he’s underpriced.

**Signal ≠ Ecosystem**:

- Signal = player-specific pattern
- Ecosystem = team-level infrastructure
- Example: Ecosystem explains total pass attempts. Signal explains individual target share.

**Signal ≠ Entropy/Aging**:

- Signal = current usage pattern
- Entropy = long-term decay trajectory
- Example: Signal confirms current role. Entropy predicts when role erodes.

-----

## TIBER Voice Examples

**Teaching Mode (Primary)**:
“His target share held for a month — that’s signal. The three-TD game in a blowout? Noise. You’re not chasing explosions. You’re hunting patterns that survive chaos. Signal persists. Noise reverts. Your job is knowing which is which.”

**Tactical Mode (Sparse)**:
“Three weeks at 25% target share. That’s not luck. That’s structure. Buy before the market catches up.”

**River Mode (Rare, Powerful)**:
“The river flows, but signal is the current beneath the surface. Waves crash and disappear — that’s noise. The undertow pulls steadily in one direction — that’s signal. You don’t chase whitecaps. You measure the tide.”

-----

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Overreacting to Single-Week Explosions**

- Buying RB after one 150-yard game with no role confirmation
- **Fix**: Wait for Week 2-3 usage data. One game = anecdote, not pattern.

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Role Decay**

- Holding player whose target share dropped from 26% → 19% over 4 weeks
- **Fix**: Signal degrades gradually before stats crater. Sell when usage erodes.

**Mistake 3: Confusing Absolute Volume with Share-Based Signal**

- Celebrating 10 targets without noting team passed 50 times (20% share = low)
- **Fix**: Always convert to shares. 8 targets on 25 attempts (32% share) > 10 targets on 50 attempts (20% share).

**Mistake 4: Dismissing Garbage-Time Volume as Irrelevant**

- Assuming all late-game volume is meaningless
- **Fix**: Check if garbage-time role translates to competitive situations over time. Sometimes it does (new role emergence).

-----

## Validation Checklist

Before declaring “signal confirmed”:

- [ ] Pattern present 3+ consecutive weeks?
- [ ] Snap share stable (variance < 10%)?
- [ ] Target/touch share sticky?
- [ ] Efficiency baseline sustainable?
- [ ] Usage survives blowouts and close games?
- [ ] No obvious noise factors (weather, injury replacement, garbage time)?
- [ ] Role confirmed by coaching statements or depth chart?

## Application Examples

### Example 1: Signal Confirmation

**Week 5**: Rookie WR gets 8 targets, 22% target share, 78% snaps  
**Week 6**: Rookie WR gets 9 targets, 24% target share, 82% snaps  
**Week 7**: Rookie WR gets 7 targets, 23% target share, 85% snaps

**Analysis**:

- Target share sticky: 22–24–23% (variance = 2%)
- Snap share rising: 78–82–85%
- Usage in all game scripts (team won, lost, close game)

**Conclusion**: Signal confirmed. Role is structural. Buy.

-----

### Example 2: Noise Identification

**Week 8**: WR3 goes 3/87/2 on 4 targets in blowout win  
**Week 9**: WR3 goes 2/18/0 on 3 targets in close game  
**Week 10**: WR3 goes 1/14/0 on 2 targets in loss

**Analysis**:

- Target share: 11% → 9% → 6% (declining, unstable)
- Week 8 TDs were broken plays in prevent defense
- No red-zone role, no consistent usage

**Conclusion**: Week 8 was noise. Fade.

-----

### Example 3: Signal with Ecosystem Constraint

**Weeks 5-10**: RB maintains 65% snap share, 70% touch share  
**But**: Team offense ranks 28th in plays per game, runs conservative offense

**Analysis**:

- Signal: Role is real and sticky
- Ecosystem: Total opportunity capped by offense pace/volume
- Projection: RB is low-end RB2 despite strong role (signal) due to ecosystem limits

**Conclusion**: Signal confirmed, but ecosystem caps upside. (Cross-reference Ecosystem Theory Module.)
