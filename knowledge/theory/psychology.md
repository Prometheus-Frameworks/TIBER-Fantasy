## Core Concept

Fantasy markets are driven by emotion at least as much as performance.

**Price = Reality + Crowd Tilt**

Your edge is separating the two and trading against tilt.

**The market is frequently wrong. Your job is being right when it matters.**

-----

## Market vs Reality Framework

### Reality (Objective)

- Snap share, target share, touch share
- Efficiency metrics (YPRR, YPC, EPA)
- Role structure and depth chart
- Ecosystem quality
- Age and entropy trajectory

### Crowd Tilt (Subjective)

- Recency bias
- Narrative momentum
- Name recognition
- Draft pedigree overweighting
- Fear and greed cycles

**Key Insight**: When tilt and reality diverge significantly, edge exists.

-----

## Primary Exploitable Biases

### 1. Recency Bias

**Definition**: Overweighting recent performance while ignoring base rates and long-term patterns.

**Manifestations**:

- Single-game explosion creates buying frenzy
- Two-game slump creates panic selling
- “What have you done for me this week?” pricing
- Ignoring 8-week baseline in favor of last 2 weeks

**Exploitation**:

- **Buy**: After 1-2 week slumps if role/usage intact (reality stable, tilt down)
- **Sell**: After 1-2 week explosions if role unchanged (tilt up, reality stable)

**Example**: WR has 25% target share all season, 12 PPG baseline. Has 2 games with 6 points. Market panic-sells. Reality = role unchanged. **Buy.**

**Key Test**: Did usage change or did outcomes variance? If usage stable, recency bias = exploitable.

-----

### 2. Rookie Fever & Age Panic

**Definition**: Systematic overvaluation of youth and undervaluation of age.

**Rookie Fever**:

- Draft hype creates inflated prices
- Potential > production pricing
- “Dynasty value” premium even in redraft
- Ignoring actual role and usage

**Age Panic**:

- 28-year-old RBs priced as washed
- 31-year-old WRs undervalued despite production
- Ignoring actual performance in favor of age stereotype

**Exploitation**:

- **Buy**: Aging players still producing efficiently with secure roles (age panic discount)
- **Sell**: Rookies with inflated prices pre-role-confirmation (rookie fever premium)

**Example**: 30-year-old WR gets 25% target share, 15 PPG. Market values at WR20. 23-year-old WR gets 18% target share, 11 PPG. Market values at WR15. **Swap.**

**Key Insight**: Market cares about age. You care about production + role. Exploit the gap.

-----

### 3. Narrative Chasing

**Definition**: Pricing based on storyline rather than data.

**Common Narratives**:

- “New OC will unlock him”
- “QB upgrade means WR breakout”
- “Offensive genius HC joins team”
- “Contract year motivation”
- “Healthy at last”

**Reality Check**:

- Does narrative have structural support? (New OC + actual role elevation = real)
- Is narrative priced in? (If everyone knows, edge gone)

**Exploitation**:

- **Fade**: Narratives without usage data backing
- **Buy**: Counter-narratives with strong usage reality

**Example**: “RB in contract year will explode!” Narrative drives price up. Check: Snap share flat at 45%, team signed veteran. Reality says no breakout. **Fade.**

**Key Test**: Remove the narrative. Would data alone support the price? If no, it’s narrative premium.

-----

### 4. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)

**Definition**: Panic buying due to fear of losing opportunity.

**Triggers**:

- Waiver wire breakout (everyone wants him)
- Trade deadline desperation
- Playoff roster construction urgency
- “Last chance” mentality

**Exploitation**:

- **Sell**: Into FOMO spikes (temporary premium)
- **Avoid**: FOMO buying yourself (patience > panic)

**Example**: Backup RB explodes after starter injury in Week 10. Entire league bidding. You own him. Market pays 2x his sustainable value. **Sell.**

**Key Insight**: FOMO creates temporary pricing inefficiencies. Sell into them.

-----

### 5. Post-Injury Over-Correction

**Definition**: Market either panics or ignores injury based on recency and narrative, not medical reality.

**Two Patterns**:

**Over-Panic**:

- Minor injury (1-2 weeks) treated as career-threatening
- Price craters despite clean medical prognosis
- Market assumes re-injury will occur

**Over-Ignore**:

- Major injury (Achilles, ACL) treated as “he’ll bounce back”
- Price holds despite structural risks
- Market assumes 100% recovery

**Exploitation**:

- **Buy**: Over-panic on minor injuries with clean recovery timelines
- **Sell**: Over-ignore on major injuries, especially aging players

**Example**: 26-year-old WR has 2-week hamstring strain. Market panic-sells at WR35. Medical reports say clean, no structural damage. Role intact. **Buy.**

-----

## Price = Reality + Crowd Tilt (Formula)

### Step 1: Determine Reality Value

- What is player’s true production projection based on:
  - Usage (snap share, target/touch share)
  - Efficiency baseline
  - Ecosystem quality
  - Age and entropy factors

**Reality Value = Expected PPG based on usage + efficiency**

-----

### Step 2: Identify Crowd Tilt

- Is player priced above or below reality value?
- What bias is driving the tilt?
  - Recency (recent explosion or slump)
  - Age (rookie fever or age panic)
  - Narrative (media hype or pessimism)
  - FOMO (scarcity panic)
  - Injury (over-panic or over-ignore)

**Crowd Tilt = Current Market Price - Reality Value**

-----

### Step 3: Exploit the Gap

**Positive Tilt (Overpriced)**:

- Market Price > Reality Value
- **Action**: Sell or avoid

**Negative Tilt (Underpriced)**:

- Market Price < Reality Value
- **Action**: Buy aggressively

**Neutral (Efficient)**:

- Market Price ≈ Reality Value
- **Action**: Hold or skip (no edge)

-----

## Market Cycle Patterns

### Fear Windows (Maximum Buy Opportunity)

**Characteristics**:

- Panic selling after injury, slump, or bad news
- “I need to get off this guy” mentality
- Prices crater below reality value
- Emotion > logic

**When They Occur**:

- Post-injury (even minor)
- After 2-3 game slump
- Bad team news (OC fired, QB injured)
- Early-season panic (Weeks 2-4)

**Strategy**:

- **Buy** assets with intact usage despite fear
- Require role/usage confirmation (reality check)
- Avoid buying narratives alone

**Example**: Elite WR has 3 straight games under 50 yards. Target share held at 28%, just bad TD luck. Market panic-sells at WR25. Reality = WR10. **Buy.**

-----

### Greed Windows (Maximum Sell Opportunity)

**Characteristics**:

- Euphoria after explosion or hot streak
- “I have to get this guy!” mentality
- Prices spike above reality value
- FOMO > logic

**When They Occur**:

- After 2-3 game explosion
- Waiver wire breakout hype
- Narrative momentum (new OC, QB upgrade)
- Post-draft rookie fever

**Strategy**:

- **Sell** into greed spikes
- Collect premium for temporary tilt
- Avoid attachment (“but he could be special!”)

**Example**: Backup RB explodes for 150 yards + 2 TDs in one game. Starter returns next week. Market offers RB15 price. Reality = RB30. **Sell.**

-----

## Uncertainty as Edge

**Principle**: Highest edge lives in uncertainty because crowds avoid ambiguity.

**Why Uncertainty Creates Edge**:

- Ambiguous situations = fewer bidders
- Fewer bidders = lower prices
- Lower prices = value if you can tolerate uncertainty

**Exploitable Uncertainty**:

- Timeshare backfields (unknown split)
- Post-injury returns (unknown workload)
- Rookie usage (unknown role)
- New coaching staffs (unknown scheme)

**Decision Framework**:

- Assess: What’s the range of outcomes?
- Price: What’s market pricing in?
- Edge: Is average outcome > market price?

**Example**: RB timeshare, 50/50 split projected. Market prices both as RB35. Reality: One will emerge. Average outcome = one RB20, one RB45. Expected value = RB32.5. Both priced at RB35. **Buy both**, trade winner.

**Key Insight**: Market hates uncertainty. You embrace it when math favors you.

-----

## Market Psychology vs Other Theories (Non-Overlap Validation)

**Market Psychology ≠ Pressure Theory**:

- Pressure = objective forces causing production
- Market Psychology = subjective crowd perception
- Example: Pressure identifies the breakout. Market Psychology determines if he’s underpriced.

**Market Psychology ≠ Signal Theory**:

- Signal = objective usage patterns
- Market Psychology = emotional pricing
- Example: Signal confirms sticky role. Market Psychology says whether crowd sees it yet.

**Market Psychology ≠ Entropy/Aging**:

- Entropy = objective decay
- Market Psychology = emotional age bias
- Example: Entropy says player declining. Market Psychology says whether he’s already underpriced for it.

**Market Psychology ≠ Ecosystem**:

- Ecosystem = team infrastructure
- Market Psychology = crowd perception of ecosystem
- Example: Ecosystem says team pass-heavy. Market Psychology says whether WRs are overpriced due to hype.

-----

## Advanced Edge Detection

### Contrarian Indicators

**When to Be Contrarian**:

- Consensus > 80% on one side
- Emotional language dominates discussion (“must-have”, “avoid at all costs”)
- Narrative divorced from usage data
- Price moved significantly without role change

**When NOT to Be Contrarian**:

- Consensus backed by usage data (signal + market agreement)
- Structural changes confirmed (injury, trade, depth chart)
- You’re being contrarian for contrarian’s sake (ego trap)

**Key**: Contrarian when crowd is emotional. Consensus when crowd is logical.

-----

### Sentiment Analysis

**Bullish Indicators (Consider Fading)**:

- Player mentioned constantly on podcasts/Twitter
- “League winner” language
- Unanimous waiver wire #1
- Zero dissenting opinions

**Bearish Indicators (Consider Buying)**:

- Player dismissed as “done”
- Advice columns say “drop”
- Trade offers way below prior value
- Unanimous avoidance

**Key**: When sentiment extreme, reality often milder. Exploit the gap.

-----

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Being Contrarian Without Data**

- “Everyone is high on him so I’m fading”
- **Reality**: If role + usage + efficiency all support, consensus may be correct
- **Fix**: Be contrarian only when data contradicts consensus

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Your Own Biases**

- Holding players due to draft cost (sunk cost fallacy)
- Avoiding players due to past burns (recency on yourself)
- **Fix**: Trade based on current reality, not past emotions

**Mistake 3: Overestimating Market Irrationality**

- Assuming every consensus is wrong
- **Reality**: Sometimes market is right
- **Fix**: Validate contrarian views with usage data

**Mistake 4: Timing Edge Wrong**

- Buying fear too early (before role confirmed)
- Selling greed too late (after market corrects)
- **Fix**: Monitor usage data in real-time to time entry/exit

-----

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Assess Reality Value

- Check usage (snap share, target/touch share)
- Review efficiency (YPRR, YPC, EPA)
- Evaluate ecosystem
- Consider age/entropy

**Output**: Reality Value (expected production)

-----

### Step 2: Assess Market Price

- Check trade values, rankings, consensus
- Identify crowd sentiment (fear, greed, neutral)
- Look for bias patterns (recency, age, narrative)

**Output**: Market Price (current valuation)

-----

### Step 3: Calculate Edge

```
Edge = Reality Value - Market Price

If Edge > 0 (underpriced): Buy
If Edge < 0 (overpriced): Sell
If Edge ≈ 0 (efficient): Hold or skip
```

-----

### Step 4: Identify Bias Driving Edge

- Recency bias? (short-term slump/explosion)
- Age bias? (rookie fever / age panic)
- Narrative? (hype without data)
- FOMO? (panic buying)
- Injury? (over-reaction)

**Output**: Root cause of mispricing

-----

### Step 5: Exploit

- **Buy**: Negative tilt (fear, panic, age discount)
- **Sell**: Positive tilt (greed, hype, FOMO)
- **Hold**: Neutral tilt (efficient market)

-----

## TIBER Voice Examples

**Teaching Mode (Primary)**:
“The market just cut his value in half because he laid an egg. That’s not a red flag — that’s the discount rack. Check the data: Did his role change? No. Did his efficiency crater? No. It’s one bad game. The crowd panicked. You profit.”

**Tactical Mode (Sparse)**:
“Two-game slump, target share still 26%. Market offering WR25 price. Reality = WR15. Buy window: next 3 days before he goes off and market corrects.”

**River Mode (Rare, Powerful)**:
“The crowd flows like water — fast, reactive, forgetful. You are the stone in the riverbed. Unmoved by current. Patient in chaos. The water crashes, you endure. When it recedes, you see what was always underneath.”

-----

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Recency Bias Exploitation

**Situation**: Elite RB has 3-game stretch: 14, 8, 11 fantasy points. Prior 6 games averaged 18 PPG.

**Market Reaction**: Panic. Trade offers at RB18 value.

**Reality Check**:

- Snap share: 78% → 76% → 80% (stable)
- Touch share: 65% (stable)
- Efficiency: Faced 3 top-5 run defenses
- Role: Unchanged

**Analysis**:

- Reality Value = RB8 (usage + efficiency baseline)
- Market Price = RB18 (recency bias)
- Edge = +10 spots underpriced

**Action**: **Buy** aggressively.

-----

### Example 2: Rookie Fever Sale

**Situation**: Rookie WR drafted Round 1, preseason hype everywhere, priced as WR12 in August.

**Market Reaction**: FOMO. “Can’t miss on this guy!”

**Reality Check**:

- Snap share Week 1-3: 45%, 52%, 48%
- Target share: 15%, 18%, 16%
- Team runs 11 personnel with 3 established WRs
- OC historically uses veteran-heavy rotations

**Analysis**:

- Reality Value = WR30 (limited role, crowded depth chart)
- Market Price = WR12 (rookie fever)
- Edge = -18 spots overpriced

**Action**: **Sell** into hype.

-----

### Example 3: Post-Injury Buy

**Situation**: 27-year-old WR suffers Grade 1 hamstring strain, out 2 weeks. Market panic-sells.

**Market Reaction**: “Hamstrings linger! He’s droppable!”

**Reality Check**:

- Medical reports: Clean recovery, no structural damage
- Target share prior to injury: 27% (WR1 role)
- Team passing volume: Top 5
- Return timeline: Week 8 (clear date)

**Analysis**:

- Reality Value = WR12 (elite role, clean recovery)
- Market Price = WR28 (injury panic)
- Edge = +16 spots underpriced

**Action**: **Buy** during panic window.

-----

## Validation Checklist

Before declaring “market mispricing”:

- [ ] Reality value calculated from usage + efficiency?
- [ ] Market price verified from trade values/rankings?
- [ ] Edge quantified (how many spots off)?
- [ ] Bias identified (recency, age, narrative, FOMO, injury)?
- [ ] Counter-evidence considered (am I missing something)?
- [ ] Timing appropriate (fear/greed window active)?

**5+ Yes = Edge Confirmed. Execute.**
