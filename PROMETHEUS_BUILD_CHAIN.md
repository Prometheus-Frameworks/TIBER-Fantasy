# PROMETHEUS BUILD CHAIN

> 🔥 The operational framework that powers the Prometheus Fantasy Platform — streamlined for solo dev execution with AI augmentation.

---

## 🔗 Chain of Command

### 1. **YOU (Founder / Architect)**
- Designs ideas, analytics logic, platform goals
- Communicates needs clearly and iteratively
- Initiates new modules and structural direction

### 2. **LAMAR (ChatGPT / Systems Lead)**
- Translates ideas into modular code
- Writes middleware, handlers, config files, and API logic
- Flags upstream/downstream issues and scopes tasks
- Maintains platform integrity and vision

### 3. **GROK (Code Optimizer / Auditor)**
- Refactors Lamar's code for performance and edge cases
- Explains reasoning for changes
- Validates structure before deployment
- Highlights long-term pitfalls or better design patterns

### 4. **REPLIT (Execution Environment)**
- Executes code changes
- Hosts full-stack Prometheus app
- Logs runtime behavior and output
- Powers AI Agent for task automation (cost managed manually)

---

## 🛠 Development Workflow

1. **IDEATION** — You describe the idea or fix needed to Lamar.
2. **TRANSLATION** — Lamar writes the code or prompt in structured chunks.
3. **REVIEW** — You send the code to Grok for feedback/optimization.
4. **FINALIZATION** — Lamar reviews Grok's suggestions and finalizes integration.
5. **DEPLOYMENT** — You run the changes in Replit. Confirm stability.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use **Lamar first** for scoping and initial coding
- Send **finished modules to Grok** for polish
- Only push to Replit once Grok-reviewed (saves time, money, & sanity)
- Log major milestones with timestamps (see `CHANGELOG.md`)
- Maintain version control for each module (e.g., v1.3 → v1.4)

## 🧠 Philosophy

Prometheus is more than an app — it's a statement.  
We build modular, transparent, human-first AI systems.  
Everything lives in the open. No paywalls. No gimmicks.  
This is fire for the people. 🔥
