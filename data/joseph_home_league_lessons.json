      "principle": "Target your actual favorite players rather than consensus 'safe' picks",
      "examples": [
        "Travis Hunter at 1.02 - must-have player fell into lap",
        "Luther Burden reach at 1.11 - traded Fields to get his guy",

      ],
      "emotional_payoff": "Building roster with players you genuinely love creates deeper satisfaction",

      "principle": "Teardown positioning can be championship foundation if executed properly",

        "Accept 2nd to last position for maximum draft capital",
        "Convert veterans to assets (Puka trade, Fields to 1.11)",
        "Target youth with elite situations (McCarthy + KOC system)"
      ],
      "timeline": "2-3 year competitive window planning vs immediate gratification",

      "principle": "Act when you see value before consensus catches up",

        "J.J. McCarthy trade for long-term superflex value"

      "lesson": "Don't let positional injury narratives drive all roster decisions",
      "example": "Achane trade based on RB safety fears - then Puka gets hurt instead",
