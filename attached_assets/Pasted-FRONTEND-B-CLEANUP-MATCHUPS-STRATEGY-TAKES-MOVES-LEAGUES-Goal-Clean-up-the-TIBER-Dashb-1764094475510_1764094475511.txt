FRONTEND “B CLEANUP” (MATCHUPS / STRATEGY / TAKES / MOVES / LEAGUES)

Goal:
Clean up the TIBER Dashboard feature tabs so everything is honest, stable, and visually readable, even while the deeper FORGE work is pending.

Scope: frontend only (React/TSX).
Do not delete any of these features; we’re stabilizing and re-labeling them, not ripping them out.

Focus on the following areas:

Matchups (Defense vs Position)

Strategy Guide

Weekly Takes

Trade & Move Analyzer

League Management / Leagues

1) Matchups (Defense vs Position)

This is the “Defense vs Position Matchups” view showing N/A for EPA, fantasy points, sample size, etc.

Tasks:

Locate the component(s) powering this view (likely under client/src/components/tabs or similar).

If the backend returns no data for the selected week:

Do not show fake-looking N/A cards that look like bugs.

Instead, show a clean “empty state”:

Icon + text like:

“Matchup data isn’t available yet. This view will be powered by the upcoming FORGE engine.”

Keep the tab & layout; just make the empty state intentional and visually clear.

Make sure the component handles missing/empty data gracefully:

No console errors

No infinite spinners

No crashing if response arrays are empty or undefined

Do not try to “fake” matchup data. This tab is being reserved for FORGE.

2) Strategy Guide

This is the “Week X Strategy Guide” page with Start/Sit, Waiver Targets, SOS Rankings tabs. Right now it’s effectively empty (“No games scheduled for week X”).

We want to redefine it as a future “Fantasy Philosophy / Strategy Hub”, not a broken tool.

Tasks:

Locate the Strategy tab/page component.

Keep the overall layout and tabs, but:

Add a clear banner or section at the top saying something like:

“The Strategy Hub is evolving. This space will host fantasy philosophy, roster-building frameworks, and game theory concepts – not just more generic start/sit tools.”

For Start/Sit / Waiver / SOS:

If the APIs currently return no data, keep the UI but:

Replace generic error / “no games scheduled” messaging with a more intentional placeholder:

“Dynamic strategy tools are under reconstruction and will return in a future update.”

Ensure no failing/broken requests cause console noise or UI glitches.

Do not delete the components or routes – just make the current state honest & stable.

3) Weekly Takes

This one actually has sample data (e.g., P. Nacua / McBride takes), but the text color is hard to read.

Tasks:

Find the Weekly Takes component (cards grouped by position).

Improve readability:

Increase contrast for body text and bullet text.

Ensure links / bold player names are clearly legible on the dark background.

You can tweak Tailwind classes (font weight, text color, etc.) to achieve a clean, readable look.

Preserve existing sample data and structure.

Make sure the component handles “no takes available” gracefully for any position (no ugly layout gaps).

No logic changes needed here beyond defensive coding and styling. This tab is a keeper.

4) Trade & Move Analyzer (“Moves” Page)

This page currently reads like a fully built feature but the backend logic has been mostly superseded by new trade systems we’re planning.

We want to keep the page as a shell but be honest about its status.

Tasks:

Locate the Trade & Move Analyzer component/page.

Update the hero text + planned features section to make it clear this is a work-in-progress trade engine, for example:

Title can stay “Trade & Move Analyzer” (or similar).

Subtext should say something like:

“This page will host the FORGE-powered trade engine: consolidation penalties, future value curves, and true dynasty leverage analysis. The current version is in preview and major upgrades are coming.”

Buttons / CTAs:

If any buttons currently trigger old/fragile trade endpoints:

Either disable them with a tooltip like “Temporarily disabled during system rebuild”

Or ensure they safely call endpoints that return a graceful “under construction” response.

Ensure there are no runtime errors if data is missing or endpoints return 4xx/5xx.

Do not remove the page – just make it safe and honest until the new trade engine is implemented.

5) League Management (“Leagues” Page)

This is a flagship feature (Sleeper league sync, multi-league dashboard, team value, etc.). We want to keep it prominent, but it may be partially wired or unstable.

Tasks:

Locate the League Management / Leagues component.

Add a small status banner near the top, something like:

“League sync is in early prototype mode. Features may be incomplete or unstable while we rebuild the engine behind it.”

Audit current behavior:

If it automatically fires heavy sync calls on load, make sure:

Errors are caught and surfaced as friendly messages

The UI doesn’t hang or show blank content if sync fails

If some planned features don’t exist yet (team value charts, league value comparisons, etc.), label them as “Coming soon” rather than leaving empty sections.

Don’t remove any working league sync logic – just guard it with good error handling and honest copy.

6) General Frontend Hygiene for These Areas

For all five sections above:

Ensure no console errors occur when:

APIs return empty arrays

APIs 404/410/500

There is no data for the selected week/season

Prefer:

Clear, intentional empty states

“Coming soon / Rebuilding with FORGE” style messaging

Stable layout even when data is missing

Don’t invent fake data.
If data isn’t there, we acknowledge it and make it look clean.

7) Final Report

When done, please summarize:

Files/components you modified

Any API calls you guarded or disabled

Exact empty-state / banner messages you ended up using

Confirmation that:

Matchups tab loads with a clean empty state (not N/A spam)

Strategy tab is stable and clearly “under reconstruction”

Weekly Takes is readable

Trade & Move Analyzer doesn’t hit broken endpoints and is labeled correctly

League Management loads without crashes and explains its prototype status

Do not implement FORGE itself here – this is a cleanup and honesty pass only.
