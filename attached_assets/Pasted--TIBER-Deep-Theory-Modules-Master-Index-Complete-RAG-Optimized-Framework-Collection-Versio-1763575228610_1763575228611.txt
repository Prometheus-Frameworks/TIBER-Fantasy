## 1. Pressure Theory

**File**: `PRESSURE_THEORY_MODULE.md`  
**Length**: ~5,000 words  
**Tags**: [“deep_theory”, “river”, “teaching”, “breakouts”, “regression”]

### Core Concept

Breakouts occur when three independent forces align simultaneously:

- **Internal Pressure**: Raw talent + athleticism
- **Structural Pressure**: Role + volume + opportunity
- **External Pressure**: Scheme change, injury vacuum, QB upgrade

Players are pressure vessels. When forces compound, production explodes. When they scatter, output returns to equilibrium.

### Key Decision Rules

- Never chase breakouts missing at least two pressure sources
- Fade single-pressure spikes (talent-only or opportunity-only)
- Buy alignment, sell equilibrium
- Triple alignment = aggressive buy
- Dual alignment = watch zone
- Single alignment = avoid

### Critical Sections

- Three Pressure Vectors (detailed definitions)
- Pressure Alignment Framework (triple, dual, single)
- Pressure Decay (regression mechanics)
- Edge Cases (when pressure exceeds role stability)
- Non-Overlap Validation vs other theories

### TIBER Voice Highlight

> “Pressure doesn’t lie. When it builds in multiple directions, something has to give — usually the box score.”

## 2. Signal Theory

**File**: `SIGNAL_THEORY_MODULE.md`  
**Length**: ~4,500 words  
**Tags**: [“deep_theory”, “river”, “teaching”, “signal_detection”, “sustainability”]

### Core Concept

Signal = repeatable, coach-intentioned patterns that survive chaos  
Noise = everything else

Signal persists. Noise reverts.

### Signal Characteristics

1. Stable role week-to-week
1. Sticky usage metrics (target share, touch share)
1. Repeatable efficiency
1. Consistent deployment regardless of score

### Noise Characteristics

1. Random touchdowns (no red-zone role)
1. Garbage-time volume
1. One-game weather anomalies
1. Temporary teammate injuries

### Key Decision Rules

- Require three consecutive weeks before treating pattern as signal
- Discount single-game explosions unless role confirms
- Prioritize sticky usage (shares) over flashy box scores (totals)
- Signal with low efficiency = monitor for improvement or role erosion

### Critical Sections

- Three-Week Rule (confirmation protocol)
- Signal vs Noise Decision Framework
- Edge Cases (signal conflicts with low efficiency, short-term noise becomes long-term signal)
- Common Mistakes (overreacting to explosions, ignoring role decay)

### TIBER Voice Highlight

> “His target share held for a month — that’s signal. The three-TD game in a blowout? Noise.”

## 3. Entropy & Aging Theory

**File**: `ENTROPY_AGING_THEORY_MODULE.md`  
**Length**: ~4,800 words  
**Tags**: [“deep_theory”, “river”, “teaching”, “aging”, “decay”, “lifecycle”]

### Core Concept

Fantasy careers follow thermodynamic decay: youth stores potential, peak converts it, age leaks it irreversibly.

Entropy is one-directional. Once decay begins, it doesn’t reverse.

### Three Lifecycle Phases

1. **Ascending Youth**: Potential energy (buy pre-proof)
1. **Peak Production**: Kinetic energy (rent aggressively)
1. **Declining Age**: Entropy leak (sell before cliff)

### Entropy Vectors

1. Loss of explosiveness & burst
1. Accumulated injuries
1. Role compression from younger players
1. Scheme irrelevance
1. Declining recovery

### Positional Entropy Curves

- **RBs**: Sharp cliff at 27-28
- **WR/TE**: Gradual decline until 30-31
- **QBs**: Sustained longer unless mobility-dependent

### Key Decision Rules

- Buy ascending youth before proof
- Rent peak production aggressively
- Sell aging assets before market sees drop
- Exit one season too early > holding one season too long

### Critical Sections

- Entropy Vectors (detailed decay mechanisms)
- Positional Curves (position-specific timelines)
- Early Warning Signals (three-tier red flag system)
- Edge Case (second peak after ecosystem upgrade)

### TIBER Voice Highlight

> “Entropy doesn’t send a memo. One year you’re elite, next year you’re surviving on reputation.”

## 4. Market Psychology Theory

**File**: `MARKET_PSYCHOLOGY_THEORY_MODULE.md`  
**Length**: ~5,200 words  
**Tags**: [“deep_theory”, “river”, “teaching”, “psychology”, “valuation”, “edge”]

### Core Concept

Fantasy markets are driven by emotion at least as much as performance.

**Price = Reality + Crowd Tilt**

Your edge is separating the two.

### Primary Exploitable Biases

1. **Recency Bias**: Overweighting recent games
1. **Rookie Fever & Age Panic**: Systematic over/undervaluation by age
1. **Narrative Chasing**: Pricing storylines over data
1. **FOMO**: Panic buying
1. **Post-Injury Over-Correction**: Over-panic or over-ignore

### Market Cycle Patterns

- **Fear Windows**: Maximum buy opportunity (panic selling)
- **Greed Windows**: Maximum sell opportunity (euphoria)
- **Uncertainty as Edge**: Crowds avoid ambiguity = value

### Key Decision Rules

- Buy maximum fear windows (panic on intact roles)
- Sell maximum greed windows (FOMO spikes)
- Exploit uncertainty when math favors you
- Be contrarian when crowd is emotional, consensus when crowd is logical

### Critical Sections

- Price = Reality + Crowd Tilt formula
- Market vs Reality Framework
- Sentiment Analysis (bullish/bearish indicators)
- Real-World Examples (recency bias, rookie fever, post-injury buy)

### TIBER Voice Highlight

> “The market just cut his value in half because he laid an egg. That’s not a red flag — that’s the discount rack.”

## 5. Ecosystem & Role Theory

**File**: `ECOSYSTEM_ROLE_THEORY_MODULE.md`  
**Length**: ~5,500 words  
**Tags**: [“deep_theory”, “river”, “teaching”, “ecosystem”, “context”, “infrastructure”]

### Core Concept

Production is a function of system + role first, talent second.

No player exists in isolation.

### Evaluation Hierarchy (in order)

1. Offensive philosophy & pace
1. Quarterback competence
1. Offensive line quality & scheme fit
1. Depth-chart monopoly
1. Red-zone hierarchy
1. Game-script tendency

### Ecosystem Impact Formula

```
Production Ceiling = (Talent × Ecosystem Quality × Role %)
```

### Ecosystem Change Catalysts

- Coordinator changes
- Quarterback changes
- Offensive line upgrades/downgrades
- Pace changes

### Key Decision Rules

- Prefer lesser talent in elite ecosystem
- Fade best athlete in broken offense
- Role compression kills even great players
- System upgrades revive careers overnight

### Critical Sections

- Evaluation Hierarchy (detailed 6-layer assessment)
- Ecosystem + Talent = Production Ceiling
- Ecosystem Caps & Floors (high vs low ceiling systems)
- Edge Cases (ecosystem distorts talent perception, mid-season changes)

### TIBER Voice Highlight

> “His talent didn’t vanish — the ecosystem collapsed around him. Production follows structure, not the name on the jersey.”

## 📊 Theory Interaction Map

### How Theories Work Together

**Pressure + Signal**:

- Pressure identifies breakout candidates
- Signal confirms sustainability
- Example: Pressure explains the role elevation. Signal confirms it holds for 3+ weeks.

**Pressure + Entropy**:

- Pressure creates breakouts
- Entropy causes regression
- Example: Young player has triple pressure alignment (breakout). Aging player loses pressure forces (regression).

**Signal + Ecosystem**:

- Ecosystem provides total opportunity
- Signal confirms individual share
- Example: Ecosystem says team passes 40 times/game. Signal says WR gets 25% targets = 10 targets/game.

**Market Psychology + All Others**:

- Other theories determine reality value
- Market Psychology determines if price matches reality
- Example: Pressure + Signal + Ecosystem say WR15. Market prices at WR25. Edge = buy.

**Entropy + Ecosystem**:

- Entropy causes player decay
- Ecosystem can mask (elite QB makes old WR viable) or amplify (poor ecosystem accelerates decline)
- Example: 31-year-old WR trades to elite offense. Ecosystem delays entropy 1-2 years.

## 🔍 Non-Overlap Validation

Each theory operates on a different axis. No redundancy.

|Theory               |Focus                 |Question Answered                    |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
|**Pressure**         |Forces causing change |Why is breakout/regression happening?|
|**Signal**           |Pattern sustainability|Is this repeatable or random?        |
|**Entropy**          |Aging trajectory      |When will decline occur?             |
|**Market Psychology**|Pricing efficiency    |Is player under/overvalued?          |
|**Ecosystem**        |Environmental context |Does system support production?      |

**Example Showing Non-Overlap**:

Player: 28-year-old RB on new team

- **Pressure**: Lost structural pressure (committee now), lost external pressure (bad o-line) → regression predicted
- **Signal**: Snap share dropped from 75% → 55% over 3 weeks → signal decay confirmed
- **Entropy**: Age 28 RB = warning zone, snap share erosion = early warning signal → sell window
- **Market Psychology**: Market still pricing as RB12 based on name recognition → overpriced, sell into lag
- **Ecosystem**: New team has poor o-line, run-heavy but inefficient → low ceiling even if role improves

**Conclusion**: All theories point to sell. Each provides unique lens.

1. **Start**: Pressure Theory (identify candidates with 2-3 forces)
1. **Confirm**: Signal Theory (wait for 3-week confirmation)
1. **Context**: Ecosystem Theory (validate system supports)
1. **Timing**: Market Psychology (buy before market catches up)

### For Regression Prediction

1. **Start**: Entropy Theory (check age/decay signals)
1. **Confirm**: Pressure Theory (pressure forces scattering?)
1. **Validate**: Signal Theory (signal weakening?)
1. **Exit**: Market Psychology (sell before market sees decline)

1. **Reality**: Pressure + Signal + Ecosystem → true value
1. **Price**: Market Psychology → current valuation
1. **Edge**: If Price < Reality → buy. If Price > Reality → sell.

### For Weekly Start/Sit

1. **Role**: Signal Theory (is usage sticky?)
1. **Context**: Ecosystem Theory (is system favorable?)
1. **Matchup**: (not covered in these modules, but apply situationally)

## 💡 Integration Workflow

### Step 1: Assess Player Reality

- Pressure: What forces present? (Internal, Structural, External)
- Signal: Is role/usage confirmed 3+ weeks?
- Entropy: Age trajectory? Early warning signals?
- Ecosystem: System quality? Role clarity?

**Output**: Reality Value (expected production)

### Step 2: Assess Market Price

- Market Psychology: Current valuation (rankings, trade values)
- Identify bias: Recency? Age? Narrative? FOMO?

**Output**: Market Price (current cost)

### Step 3: Calculate Edge

```
Edge = Reality Value - Market Price

If Edge > 0: Buy (underpriced)
If Edge < 0: Sell (overpriced)
If Edge ≈ 0: Hold or skip (efficient)
```

### Step 4: Execute with Confidence

- High edge (>10 spots): Aggressive
- Medium edge (5-10 spots): Measured
- Low edge (<5 spots): Optional (liquidity dependent)
