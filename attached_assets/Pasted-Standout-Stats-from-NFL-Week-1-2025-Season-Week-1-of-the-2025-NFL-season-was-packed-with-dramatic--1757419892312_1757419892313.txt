Standout Stats from NFL Week 1 (2025 Season)
Week 1 of the 2025 NFL season was packed with dramatic finishes, rookie flashes, and veteran heroics. Drawing from game recaps, PFF grades, and performance analyses, here are some of the most notable stats that jumped out from the September 4-8 slate. I’ve focused on records, surprises, comebacks, and top individual efforts.
Epic Comebacks and Clutch Moments
	•	Bills’ Historic Rally vs. Ravens: Buffalo overcame a 40-25 deficit with under four minutes left, scoring on their final three drives for a 41-40 win. Josh Allen accounted for over 400 total yards and four touchdowns (251 passing yards, one TD pass, two rushing TDs in the fourth quarter alone). This marked the first time since 1978 a player had 250+ passing yards and two rushing TDs in any single quarter. The Ravens blew their largest lead in the Lamar Jackson era (15+ points late), the first such collapse league-wide since 2017. 55 16 57 
	•	Vikings’ Rookie-Led Fourth-Quarter Surge: J.J. McCarthy became the first QB in NFL history to account for three TDs in the fourth quarter of his debut, leading Minnesota from a double-digit deficit to a 27-24 win over Chicago. He joined Steve Young as the only QBs in 45 years to rally from such a hole in a debut game. 2 
	•	Ravens’ Fourth-Down Blunder: Facing fourth-and-2.6 yards late against Buffalo, Baltimore punted instead of going for it, a decision analytics pegged as a major error that shifted win probability dramatically. 58
