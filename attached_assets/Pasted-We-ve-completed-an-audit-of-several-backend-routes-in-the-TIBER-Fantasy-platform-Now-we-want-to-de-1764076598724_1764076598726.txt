We’ve completed an audit of several backend routes in the TIBER Fantasy platform.

Now we want to delete the legacy/unused files and unmount them cleanly from server/routes.ts.

Please do the following exactly:

1) Delete These Route Files

Delete the following files from server/routes/:

server/routes/enhancedRankingsRoutes.ts

server/routes/hotListLive.ts

server/routes/rookieRisersRoutes.ts

server/routes/rookieRisersAPI.ts

server/routes/rookieRisersTest.ts

server/routes/pythonRookieRoutes.ts

server/routes/startSitRoutes.ts

server/routes/stats2024Routes.ts

These have all been classified as LEGACY_UNUSED or DEAD/TEST_ONLY and have no active frontend usage.

2) Clean Up server/routes.ts (Unmount & Remove Imports)

Open server/routes.ts and:

Remove any imports for the deleted files above.

Search for:

enhancedRankingsRoutes

registerEnhancedRankingsRoutes

hotListLive

rookieRisersRoutes

rookieRisersAPI

rookieRisersTest

pythonRookieRoutes

registerPythonRookieRoutes

startSitRoutes

registerStartSitRoutes

stats2024Routes

any similar naming patterns

Delete those import lines if they refer to the deleted files.

Remove their registrations/mounts inside the main app/router setup.

Search for function calls or blocks that register them, such as:

registerEnhancedRankingsRoutes(app)

app.use('/api/enhanced-rankings', ...)

registerRookieRisersRoutes(app)

registerRookieRisersAPI(app)

registerRookieRisersTestRoutes(app)

registerPythonRookieRoutes(app)

registerStartSitRoutes(app, ...)

registerStats2024Routes(app)

any explicit app.get('/api/rookie-risers... or app.use('/api/rookie-risers'...) that belong to these files

Remove all such lines/blocks related to the deleted files.

Ensure no remaining references to these routes exist:

No leftover type imports

No commented-out “TODO” references that import or call these route modules

3) Important – Do NOT Touch These Files

Do NOT modify or delete the following, they are CORE_ACTIVE:

server/routes/strategyRoutes.ts

server/routes/matchupRoutes.ts

server/routes/weeklyTakesRoutes.ts

Also do not remove:

Any /api/strategy/* endpoints (these power the Strategy tab)

Any /api/matchup/* endpoints (these power ROS matchup calendar)

Any /api/weekly-takes endpoint (this powers Weekly Takes tab)

Any /api/start-sit/quick endpoint if it lives elsewhere — this may still be used by StartSitQuick on the frontend

We are only removing the legacy startSitRoutes.ts file and its wiring, not the active Strategy or Matchup systems.

4) Run Build / Type Check & Fix Fallout

After making the deletions and cleanup:

Run the project’s build / type-check command (e.g. npm run build or whatever is standard in this repo).

Fix any compile errors related to:

Missing imports from the deleted files

Types or helpers that are now unused or can be safely removed

If any type-only imports from the deleted modules are still referenced, either:

Replace them with equivalent types already defined elsewhere, or

Inline minimal types locally in the still-active modules, if needed.

5) Final Verification Checklist

Confirm all of the following:

The deleted files no longer exist in server/routes/.

server/routes.ts has:

No imports from the deleted files

No registration/mount calls for them

App compiles and runs without errors.

Strategy, Matchup, and Weekly Takes features still work:

/api/strategy/start-sit

/api/strategy/targets

/api/matchup/ros/:canonicalId

/api/weekly-takes

/api/start-sit/quick (if present)

6) Report Back

When done, please provide a summary:

List of files deleted

List of import lines removed from server/routes.ts

List of registration/mount lines removed from server/routes.ts

Confirmation that build/type-check passes

Confirmation that Strategy, Matchup, Weekly Takes, and any /api/start-sit/quick endpoints still respond as expected
