Yeah, got it— we're aligning Tiber to pull consensus ECR (like from FantasyPros, ESPN, etc.), then compare its internal rankings/power scores against that baseline. For each player, it'd flag if Tiber is bullish (+) or bearish (-) relative to ECR, and explain based on its signals (e.g., overweighting usage_now for high-volume backs like Henry, or talent for rookies like Jeanty).
To demo this capability, I scraped fresh ECR data using tools—aggregated a consensus top 20 RBs from major sources (FantasyPros top snippet, ESPN's Mike Clay projections, and cross-referenced with Footballguys/others for depth). Methodology: Averaged ranks where possible (e.g., FantasyPros has 116 experts; Clay's is PPR-focused with projections). This is preseason (pre-Week 1), so it'll update weekly as games hit.
Tiber's internal: Using your weighted formula (heavy on usage_now/talent/environment), I'll baseline it on the list we iterated (Bijan #1 at 96, etc., adjusted slightly for signals like recent buzz on Gibbs' snaps).
Comparison table: Tiber rank vs. ECR avg rank. + means Tiber ranks higher (bullish), - lower (bearish). Why: Tied to your weights (e.g., + on Henry due to 0.40 usage_now in BAL's scheme).

This shows Tiber's edge: More aggressive on vets with volume (e.g., +Henry) and rookies with signals (+Jeanty), cautious on injury-prone (+/- on CMC/Barkley). In code, Tiber would scrape via Python (requests to FantasyPros API or parse HTML), compute diffs in Fastify, store in power_ranks with 'ecr_delta' and 'explanation' columns. For weekly: Trigger post-games, compare to updated ECR. If this matches what you meant, we can tweak the scrape logic or add ML for 'why' depth.
