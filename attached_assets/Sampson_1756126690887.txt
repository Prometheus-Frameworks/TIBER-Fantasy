Dylan Sampson notes 

Looking for 
	⁃	Ability to read blocks and find gaps 
	⁃	Burst and acceleration 
	⁃	Contact balance 
	⁃	Sharp cuts and agility 
	⁃	Top end speed ie breakaway potential
	⁃	Pass protection situations 
	⁃	Receiving upside ie capable pass catcher or can be deployed as a pass catcher 
	⁃	Ball security / durability concerns 


Fails to break tackles at a reliable rate often going down upon first contact 
Can make defenders miss
Would like to see more patience however once the gap is found has a rapid burst of acceleration 
Would like to see sharper cuts to bolster his rapid speed
Competent pass option out of the backfield 
Contrary to the point on patience, I do like his vision to identify tight windows, must noticeable on the goal line 
Massive big playability 
Seems to bounce right back up after taking some big hits
Excels in shovel passes and pitches in the backfield
Elusive in the sense it appears he wins off speed alone and I’m questioning his ability to replicate this at the next level
Tough runner 
Wouldn’t necessarily say he breaks tackles however extremely slippery 
Immense lower body strength and contact balance due to short stubby frame 
Likes to create some separation with spin moves 
Excellent awareness 

Final thoughts after initial watch on Dylan Sampson ( 20 yo - 5’11”, 201lbs ) (Tennessee) 

2025 stats - 258 carries, 1,491 yards, 22 TDs - 5.8 avg

First impressions on Sampson is that of an incredibly speedy and elusive back with the ability to make defenders miss in open field with a nose to get into the end zone. Sampson is also a capable pass catcher out of the backfield, most noticeably shovel passes, short passes to the flat, anything to find him in a few yards of open space however he must improve on his route running to see a valuable roll in the NFL passing game, but room for improvement. Sampson demonstrates the appropriate patience to hit gaps and once he does, the potential for a massive gain follows. Sampson uses his short yet powerful frame to bounce off defenders with lower body gravity generating a slippery bowling ball effect, yet I have concerns in his ability to replicate this at the NFL level as I would like to see sharper more aggressive cuts to aid in his elusiveness, this is proven to me by his consistent desire to spin around defenders, instead of beating them on the out / inside. I think Sampson would excel in an offensive scheme that likes to run play actions, speed options, outside zone plays, anything to maximize his speed. Concerned about ability to be a true three down back as he may very well be stuffed down in short yardage plays in the NFL, and his lack of ability in pass protection. 

Overall I give Sampson a day 3+ grade with a backup to potential starter under the right offensive scheme, and would not be surprised to see him have a fantastic finish in a fantasy football campaign, if he refines the aforementioned deficiencies in his receiving game.
