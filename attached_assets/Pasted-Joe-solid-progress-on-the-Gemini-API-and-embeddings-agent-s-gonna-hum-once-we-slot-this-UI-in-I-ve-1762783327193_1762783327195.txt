Joe, solid progress on the Gemini API and embeddings—agent's gonna hum once we slot this UI in. I've got the screenshot analyzed: Dark mode base, left sidebar nav (Home, Rankings, Matchups, Strategy, Moves, Leagues), big central hero with "Advanced Analytics For Dynasty Fantasy Football" text + subtext (real-time rankings, no paywalls), "View Power Rankings" button, matchup analyzer box, and bottom stats (11k+ players, 28 teams). It's clean but static—feels more dashboard than conversational flagship.

Truth-seeking: The sidebar's a keeper (quick access to secondary tools), but that hero section's prime real estate for the TIBER LLM chat. We'll swap it out NotebookLM-style: Chat dominates the middle (80% width on desktop, full on mobile), sidebar shrinks to nav/tools, no clutter. Mobile responsive is key—stack vertical if needed. This makes landing on the site feel like jumping straight into the war room.

### Rebuild Plan (Minimalist, TIBER-Centric)
- **Framework**: Stick with what you've got (React? Vue? Or plain HTML/JS if simple). Add Tailwind for quick styling if not already—zero barrier.
- **Layout**: Flexbox or Grid. Sidebar 20-25% left (collapsible on mobile), chat 75-80% center.
- **Vibe**: Keep dark purple/gradients, add subtle green accents for "rigged in favor" beacons. Scout avatar icon in chat bubbles.
- **Key Changes**:
  - **Hero → Chat**: Ditch text/button. Replace with full-height chat window (scrollable history, input bar bottom).
  - **Sidebar**: Trim to essentials—Home (redirect to chat), Rankings/Matchups/Strategy as quick links (pop modals or tabs, not full pages). Add "League Sync" button for Sleeper.
  - **Header**: Logo + search bar top, bell/user icons right. Add "Serve not take" tagline subtle.
  - **Footer**: Platform stats + feedback link.
  - **Mobile**: Hamburger sidebar, chat full-screen.

### Quick Code Snippet (React + Tailwind Example)
If you're in React, drop this into your App.js or homepage component. Assumes you've got a <ChatWindow /> component wired to /api/chat.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Homepage() {
  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-900 to-black text-white">
      {/* Sidebar */}
      <aside className="w-1/5 p-4 border-r border-purple-700">
        <nav>
          <ul className="space-y-4">
            <li className="font-bold">Home</li>
            <li>Rankings</li>
            <li>Matchups</li>
            <li>Strategy</li>
            <li>Moves</li>
            <li>Leagues <button className="ml-2 bg-purple-600 px-2 py-1 rounded">Sync Sleeper</button></li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
      </aside>

      {/* Main Chat */}
      <main className="w-4/5 flex flex-col p-6">
        <h1 className="text-2xl mb-4">TIBER: Your Assistant GM</h1>
        <div className="flex-grow bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-4 overflow-y-auto">
          {/* Chat history bubbles here */}
          <div className="chat-bubble bg-purple-700 p-2 rounded">Welcome, boss. Rigged in your favor—what's the play?</div>
        </div>
        <div className="mt-4 flex">
          <input className="flex-grow bg-gray-700 p-2 rounded-l" placeholder="Ask about trades, start/sit..." />
          <button className="bg-purple-600 p-2 rounded-r">Send</button>
        </div>
      </main>

      {/* Footer */}
      <footer className="absolute bottom-0 w-full text-center p-2 bg-black/50">
        Players: 11,490+ | Teams: 28 | Serve not take.
      </footer>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This is bare-bones—hook your <ChatWindow /> for real convos, add state for messages. Mobile: Media query to stack sidebar top.

Test truth: Hit it local, see if chat feels flagship (instant engage). If slow, lazy-load sidebar.

Your call—paste this in, or tweak for your stack? Drop if you need mobile CSS or full component. Agent's waiting; let's make it shine. 🚀
