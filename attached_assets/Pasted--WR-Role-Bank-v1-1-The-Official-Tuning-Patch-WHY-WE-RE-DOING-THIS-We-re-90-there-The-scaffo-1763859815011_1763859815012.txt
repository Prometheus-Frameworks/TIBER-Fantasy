🟦 WR Role Bank v1.1 — The Official Tuning Patch
✅ WHY WE’RE DOING THIS

We’re 90% there.
The scaffolding is elite.
But the weights need real-world tuning so WR roles reflect actual significance.

These fixes will raise:

Ja’Marr Chase

Chris Olave

Tyreek Hill

Puka

Pittman

And flatten:

Wan'Dale

Shakir

ROTATIONAL Gadget dudes

While keeping the good signals (Egbuka, McMillan, Rice).

🟨 PATCH 1: Increase Volume Weight (+10%)

Targets/Game should dominate WR role reality.

Before (v1.0):

Volume weight = 45%

After (v1.1):

Volume weight = 55%

This alone corrects:

Chase too low

Olave too low

Jefferson too low

Waddle too high

Shakir too high

Volume = the foundation of a WR.

🟧 PATCH 2: Decrease Consistency Penalty (–10%)

Consistency is punishing elite WRs who spike due to role.

Before:

Consistency weight = 25%

After:

Consistency weight = 15%

This fixes:

Chase

Jefferson

Deebo

Tyreek

Davante Adams

Alphas have variance.
That’s normal.

🟥 PATCH 3: Add High Value Usage Module (+10%)

This is the missing power signal.

New field: highValueScore

Ingredients:

Deep targets (20+ yards)

Intermediate targets (10–19 yards)

Red zone targets

End zone targets

Formula:

highValueScore = 
  (deepTargets * 1.6) + 
  (rzTargets * 1.8) + 
  (endzoneTargets * 2.4)


Then normalized on a 0–100 scale.

This will bump:

Chase

Olave

Pickens

Egbuka

McMillan

Davante

Tyreek

And drop:

Wan'Dale

Shakir

Screens-only dudes

🟩 PATCH 4: Normalize Scoring League-Wide

Right now, the distribution is too clustered.

v1.1 will:

Apply league-wide Z-score normalization

Scale into 0–100 bucket

Improve separation between tiers

This gives us:

Real "CO_ALPHA" spacing

Distinct "Secondary" lines

Cleaner "Rotational" cutoff

🟦 PATCH 5: Add Tier Lock Thresholds

This is the most important step for real-world alignment.

New Tier Rules (v1.1)
CO_ALPHA:
- targets/game >= 9.5
- target share >= 28%
- highValueScore >= 65

PRIMARY:
- targets/game >= 8.0
- target share >= 25%

SECONDARY:
- targets/game >= 6.0

ROTATIONAL:
- <6.0 tgt/g


This will instantly fix:

Chase

Olave

Jefferson

Puka

Pittman

And also protect rightful SECONDARY guys.

🟫 PATCH 6: Recompute & Validate Top 100 WRs

Agent will:

Re-run full 2024 WR batch

Re-run full 2025 WR batch

Compare pre/post tier changes

Verify tier locks firing properly

🟪 PATCH 7: UI Adjustments for v1.1

Small but important:

Add “High-Value Usage %” to WR tables

Add “Depth Bias” indicator (short/med/deep mix)

Update Tier colors to reflect new distribution

🟣 READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

This packet is perfectly structured for the agent.

If you want me to generate the exact JSON or code diff for the agent to ingest, just say:

“Prep the WR 1.1 patch for agent.”

But since you said RUN WR 1.1, I’ll assume you want the full operational packet — everything above is the exact plan the agent should run.
