Task: Build FORGE Matchups UI (Season + Weekly)

Goal: Add a new /matchups section that exposes the existing FORGE environment + matchup scores in a simple, interactive way. Keep the current color scheme and styling – no new visual theme, just new layouts.

1) New Routes / Structure
	•	Add /matchups with two tabs:
	•	Season View → /matchups/season
	•	Weekly Matchups → /matchups/week
	•	Default /matchups to Season View.

2) Season View (All-season “in a vacuum”)
	•	Controls:
	•	Season selector (default 2025).
	•	Table: one row per team for the selected season.
	•	Columns:
	•	Rank
	•	Team
	•	Env Score (0–100) → env_score_100
	•	Pass EPA (small number or band)
	•	Rush EPA (small number or band)
	•	Style Tag ("Pass-leaning" | "Balanced" | "Run-heavy", based on PROE / rush rate).
	•	Backend:
	•	Add GET /api/forge/env-season?season=2025
	•	It can be implemented as an aggregate over team_offensive_context (avg env_score_100 and EPA metrics over all weeks <= current week).
	•	Response per row:

{
  "season": 2025,
  "team": "KC",
  "envScore100": 58,
  "passEpaPerPlay": 0.185,
  "rushEpaPerPlay": 0.058,
  "styleTag": "Pass-leaning"
}



3) Weekly Matchups View
	•	Controls:
	•	Week selector (default current week, e.g. 12).
	•	Position selector: WR | RB | TE | QB (v0.1 = WR + RB working, TE/QB can show “coming soon”).
	•	Layout:
	•	One card per game for that week.
	•	Card header: "{OFF}@{DEF} – Week {week}" (e.g. KC @ BAL – Week 12).
	•	Inside the card, two columns:
	•	Left: OffenseTeam vs DefenseTeam (for selected position)
	•	Right: DefenseTeam’s offense vs OffenseTeam’s defense (mirrored).
	•	Each column shows:
	•	Off Env Score (env_score_100 for that offense).
	•	Matchup Score (matchup_score_100 for that offense vs that defense at that position).
	•	Band label based on score:
	•	≥ 75: Smash (strong green)
	•	60–74: Good (light green)
	•	45–59: Neutral (grey)
	•	30–44: Tough (light red)
	•	< 30: Stay Away (red)
	•	Backend:
	•	Add GET /api/forge/matchups?season=2025&week=12&position=WR
	•	This endpoint should:
	•	Join schedule + team_offensive_context + team_defensive_context.
	•	For each game, return data for both offenses.
	•	Suggested response shape:

[
  {
    "season": 2025,
    "week": 12,
    "gameId": "KC@BAL-2025-12",
    "offenseTeam": "KC",
    "defenseTeam": "BAL",
    "position": "WR",
    "offenseEnvScore100": 58,
    "offenseMatchupScore100": 73,
    "offenseBand": "Smash",
    "defenseEnvScore100": 51,
    "defenseMatchupScore100": 42,
    "defenseBand": "Tough"
  }
  // ...one object per offense per game
]


	•	If it’s easier, you can return two entries per game (one per offense) and we’ll group by gameId on the frontend.

4) Styling / Theme
	•	Reuse existing fonts, table components, and color tokens from the Rankings pages.
	•	Use existing success/danger/neutral colors for the matchup bands (green/grey/red) so it feels native.
	•	No new global layout changes – /matchups should sit alongside /rankings in the nav.
