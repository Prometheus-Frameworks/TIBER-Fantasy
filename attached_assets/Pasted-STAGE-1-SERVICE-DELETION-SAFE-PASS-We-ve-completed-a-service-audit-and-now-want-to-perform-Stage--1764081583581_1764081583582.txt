STAGE 1 SERVICE DELETION (SAFE PASS)

We’ve completed a service audit and now want to perform Stage 1 deletions:
only services classified as LEGACY_UNUSED or DEAD_ORPHAN.

These files are not imported anywhere and are safe to remove.

1) Delete the following LEGACY_UNUSED services

Please delete these files:

server/services/wrAdvancedStatsService.ts

server/services/rbAdvancedStatsService.ts

server/services/teAdvancedStatsService.ts

server/services/qbAdvancedStatsService.ts

server/services/SchedulerMigration.ts

server/services/evaluation/evaluationModules.ts

server/services/evaluation/teEvaluationService.ts

server/services/evaluation/BatchFantasyEvaluator.ts

server/services/trade/verdictSystem.ts

server/services/trade/rbValueDeRisker.ts

server/services/sleeperStrictSnapService.ts

These were identified as exported but never imported anywhere.

2) Delete the following DEAD_ORPHAN services

Please delete these files as well:

server/services/oasisApiService.ts

server/adapters/NFLDataPyAdapter.ts

server/services/ratingsEngineService.ts

server/services/snapCounts.ts

server/services/compassCacheService.ts

server/services/wrRatingsService.ts

server/services/grokProjectionsService.ts

These have no imports and no used exports in the codebase.

3) Clean up any leftover references (if present)

Even though the audit indicates these files are unused, please:

Scan the repo for any references to:

wrAdvancedStatsService

rbAdvancedStatsService

teAdvancedStatsService

qbAdvancedStatsService

SchedulerMigration

evaluationModules

teEvaluationService

BatchFantasyEvaluator

verdictSystem

rbValueDeRisker

sleeperStrictSnapService

oasisApiService

NFLDataPyAdapter

ratingsEngineService

snapCounts

compassCacheService

wrRatingsService

grokProjectionsService

If any imports or references still exist:

Remove those import lines

Remove or adjust any code that referenced these services

Goal: after deletion, no references remain anywhere in the repo.

4) Build / Type-Check and Fix Fallout

After deletions and reference cleanup:

Run the project’s usual build / type-check command.

Fix any errors caused by:

Stray imports pointing to deleted files

Now-unused variables or parameters

The goal is zero build errors and a clean TypeScript state.

5) DO NOT TOUCH (for now)

Do NOT modify or delete any of the following in this pass:

rankingsFusionService.ts

predictionEngine.ts

roleBankService.ts

UPHCoordinator.ts

IntelligentScheduler.ts

Any ECR-related services (ecrService.ts, ecrLoader.ts, enhancedEcrProvider.ts, ecrPipelineService.ts)

Any snap services other than snapCounts.ts

Any player identity services (PlayerIdentityService.ts, PlayerMappingService.ts, playerAliases.ts)

These will be refactored or removed later when we introduce FORGE (Football Oriented Recursive Grading Engine).

ECR-specific logic will be consolidated or removed in a future pass — we intend to phase out external “expert consensus” and rely on our own grading engine.

6) Final Verification Summary

When finished, please provide a short summary:

List of files successfully deleted

Any additional references you had to clean up

Confirmation that the app builds and runs successfully

Confirmation that core features (OVR, TIBER, sandboxes, analytics, strategy, matchup, weekly takes) still work

This is Stage 1 of the service cleanup only.
No refactors yet — just deletion of confirmed-unused services.
