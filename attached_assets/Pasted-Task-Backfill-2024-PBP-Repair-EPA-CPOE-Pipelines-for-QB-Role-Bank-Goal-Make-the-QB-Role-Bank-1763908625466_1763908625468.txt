Task: Backfill 2024 PBP + Repair EPA/CPOE Pipelines for QB Role Bank

Goal:
Make the QB Role Bank v1.0 fully functional for both 2024 and 2025 by:
1) Backfilling 2024 play-by-play into bronze_nflfastr_plays
2) Repairing the EPA/CPOE pipeline so qbEpaReference / qbContextMetrics (and related tables) are populated
3) Recomputing QB Role Bank for 2024 + 2025 with real efficiency scores and valid alpha tiers

PHASE 1 – Backfill 2024 NFLfastR PBP
1. Find the existing code that loaded 2025 into bronze_nflfastr_plays:
   - Likely in: server/scripts/, data ingestion utilities, or any “nflfastr”/“bronze” script
   - Reuse the exact same pipeline, but point it at the 2024 season

2. Implement 2024 ingest:
   - Download 2024 pbp parquet/CSV from the same source used for 2025 (NFLfastR)
   - Load into bronze_nflfastr_plays with the same schema as 2025
   - Ensure we have at least: game_id, play_id, passer_player_id, rusher_player_id, pass_location, yards_gained, epa, cpoe (if available), pass result flags, etc.

3. Validation queries:
   - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bronze_nflfastr_plays WHERE season = 2024;
   - SELECT season, MIN(week), MAX(week) FROM bronze_nflfastr_plays GROUP BY season;
   Expect: all 2024 weeks present (no crazy gaps).

PHASE 2 – EPA/CPOE Pipeline Repair
Objective:
Populate EPA/CPOE per QB per season/week in:
- qbEpaReference
- qbContextMetrics
- any qb_* tables that the existing EPA infra expects

1. Locate EPA-related code:
   - Search for: “qbEpaReference”, “qbContextMetrics”, “epaProcessor”, “CPOE”, “EPA”
   - Likely files:
     - server/services/epaProcessor.(ts|py)
     - server/scripts/*epa*.ts or .py
     - any calibration tools (calibrateEpaWeights.py, etc.)

2. Implement per-QB EPA/CPOE aggregation:
   Using bronze_nflfastr_plays, compute:
   - EPA per dropback
   - EPA per pass
   - Success rate
   - CPOE (if not provided, you can leave it neutral for now or derive from completion probability fields if available)
   Aggregate at:
   - season + player level
   - AND (if pipeline expects it) season + week + player level

   Store these in qbEpaReference / qbContextMetrics (or the appropriate QB EPA tables already defined in the schema).

3. Wire EPA/CPOE into QB Role Bank:
   - In the QB Role Bank service (where the 4-pillar score is calculated), replace the “flat 50 efficiency” logic with values sourced from qbEpaReference/qbContextMetrics.
   - Efficiency pillar should be based on:
     - epa_per_dropback (primary)
     - cpoe (secondary, if available)
     - optionally sack rate / turnover-worthy plays if already modeled

4. Validation:
   - Pick 3–5 QBs from 2025 (Mahomes, Lamar, Allen, Stroud, Jayden Daniels):
     - SELECT their EPA/CPOE values from qbEpaReference/qbContextMetrics
     - Confirm they are non-null and numerically reasonable (no crazy outliers like 9999).

PHASE 3 – Recompute QB Role Bank (2024 + 2025)
1. Re-run the batch script:
   - tsx server/scripts/computeAllQBRoleBank.ts 2024
   - tsx server/scripts/computeAllQBRoleBank.ts 2025

2. Expected behavior:
   - 2024 now uses real PBP + EPA/CPOE (no longer all BENCH_QB)
   - 2025 efficiency pillar no longer flat 50, true alpha tiers emerge

3. Return this summary back to me:
   - Tier distribution for 2024 and 2025:
     - Count and avg score for each: ELITE_QB1, STRONG_QB1, MID_QB1, HIGH_QB2, STREAMING_QB, BENCH_QB
   - Specific rows for:
     - Patrick Mahomes
     - Josh Allen
     - Lamar Jackson
     - CJ Stroud
     - Jayden Daniels
   For each: season, games, dropbacks/g, rush att/g, epa_per_db, efficiencyScore, final roleScore, tier, and KonamiCode/SystemQB flags.

Guardrails:
- Do NOT delete or alter any existing non-QB role bank tables.
- Do NOT hardcode any QB tiers by name; everything must come from the data.
- If EPA/CPOE is missing for a given QB/season, default efficiencyScore to 50 ONLY for that row, and log a warning so we know where data gaps are.
