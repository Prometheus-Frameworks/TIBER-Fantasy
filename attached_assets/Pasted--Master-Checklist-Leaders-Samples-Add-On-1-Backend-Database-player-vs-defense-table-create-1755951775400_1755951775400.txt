✅ Master Checklist — Leaders + Samples Add-On
1. Backend / Database

 player_vs_defense table created with:

season, week, def_team, position, player_name, player_team, fpts, player_id

 Data ingested for 2024 Weeks 1-17 (multi-thousand rows, PPR scoring).

 Indexes applied (season+week+def_team+position).

2. New API Endpoints

 /api/leaders/weekly?season=2024&week=6&position=RB

Returns top individual game performances for that week.

 /api/leaders/allowed?season=2024&week=6&position=RB

Returns total FPTS allowed by each defense that week.

 /api/sos/weekly?season=2024&week=6&position=RB&samples=5

Returns standard SOS response plus player sample breakdown for that defense (e.g. Sean Tucker 35.2 vs NO).

 Season parameter handling in place (2024 complete, 2025 live-only).

3. Frontend — Leaders Page

 New tab/panel called “Weekly Leaders” (with Week + Position selector).

 Widget #1: Top Single-Game Performances

Player row includes team logo, player name, opponent logo, FPTS.

 Widget #2: Points Allowed by Defense

Defense row includes defense logo, team abbreviation, total FPTS allowed.

 Widgets share the same controls (Season/Week/Position).

 Clicking a defense row → links back to /sos page for that defense/week.

4. Frontend — SOS Page

 Each defense row (weekly view) has a Samples Panel (if samples=N used).

Shows contributing players & FPTS totals for that matchup.

Example:

Saints vs TB RBs → 54.2 points
Sean Tucker 35.2 | Bucky Irving 19.0


 Debug mode (debug=1) still works alongside samples.

5. QA / Validation

 Player totals (from /leaders/weekly) correctly sum to defense totals (from /leaders/allowed).

 Week boundaries enforced (2024 = 17 weeks, 2025 = 18 weeks).

 Team logos render consistently (no missing images).

 UI state persists (URL reflects week/pos/season).

 Regression: Old /leaders season-long leaderboard still functional.

6. Definition of Done

Endpoints live and responding with 2024 data.

Leaders page shows both widgets.

SOS page shows samples breakdown.

Team logos consistent.

You can reproduce Saints RB example from Week 6 (Sean Tucker + Bucky).
