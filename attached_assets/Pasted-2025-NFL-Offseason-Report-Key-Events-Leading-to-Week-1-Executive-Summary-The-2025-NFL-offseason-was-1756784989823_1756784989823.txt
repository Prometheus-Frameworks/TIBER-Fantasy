Key Player Suspensions and Injuries
	•	Jordan Addison (Vikings WR): Suspended for the first three games of 2025 for violating the NFL’s substances of abuse policy, stemming from a resolved 2024 DUI case (pleaded no contest to “wet reckless” driving). 10 12 He’ll miss matchups against the Bears (Week 1), Falcons (Week 2), and Bengals (Week 3), returning Week 4 vs. Steelers. Addison, entering his third season, had 133 receptions for 1,786 yards and 19 TDs in his first two years but won’t appeal the suspension. 17 Vikings are optimistic about WR Jalen Nailor stepping up in his absence. 69 
	•	Rashee Rice (Chiefs WR): Received a six-game suspension for violating the personal conduct policy after a 2024 multi-vehicle crash in Dallas, where he pleaded guilty to felony charges and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. 20 25 Rice misses Weeks 1-6 (vs. Chargers in Brazil, Eagles, Giants, Ravens, Jaguars, Lions), eligible Week 7 vs. Raiders. No appeal; the NFL initially sought double digits, but settled at six. 22 Rice, recovering from a 2024 knee injury, had been building momentum before the suspension. 24 
	•	Joe Mixon (Texans RB): Placed on the reserve/non-football injury (NFI) list due to a foot/ankle injury sustained offseason, missing at least the first four games (vs. Rams, Buccaneers, Jaguars, Titans). 39 36 Texans GM Nick Caserio was noncommittal on Mixon’s 2025 availability, raising concerns about a potential full-season absence or retirement. 31 35 At 29, Mixon is coming off a 2024 Pro Bowl year (1,016 rush yards, 11 TDs in 14 games), but performance dipped late, fueling “cooked” narratives amid age and workload (2,313 career touches). 33 Backfield shifts to Nick Chubb, Dameon Pierce, Dare Ogunbowale, and rookie Woody Marks. 30
