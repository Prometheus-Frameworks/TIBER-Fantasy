Joe, Batch #7 reads like a victory lap, but a couple bullets don’t match the code we just hardened. I’m not letting those drift sneak into prod docs.

## 🚫 Mismatches I’m calling out

1. **Season validation**
   Summary says: “must be 2020–2030.”
   Our fix: **YYYY, 2018..(current year + 1)** with **422** on invalid. Update the doc or we’ll confuse QA and future you.

2. **Error response format**
   Summary shows:

   ```json
   { ok: false, code, message, details }
   ```

   Our contract is **errors include `meta`** too:

   ```json
   { ok: false, code, message, details, meta: { source:"sleeper", generatedAt:"..." } }
   ```

   Keep that consistent across routes or your monitors will see mixed shapes.

3. **Cache meta function**
   Summary references `getCacheMetadata()`; we shipped `getPlayersCacheMeta()` with a **compat shim**. The doc should prefer `getPlayersCacheMeta()` going forward.

4. **Performance numbers**
   “Cold 2–3s, warm 50–200ms” is fine as guidance, but call them **targets**, not guarantees.

Everything else in the summary is accurate with what we reviewed.

## ✍️ Tiber ingestion wrapper (Batch #7 summary -> finalize docs)

> **Task:** Normalize the Sleeper Sync v1.0 summary to match the implemented contract. Do not change code; this is a **docs/README** update.
>
> **Required edits:**
>
> 1. **Season validation** → “Season must be a four-digit year, **2018 through next year** (dynamic). Invalid seasons return **422**.”
> 2. **Error response** → Document that **all errors include `meta`**:
>
>    ```json
>    { "ok": false, "code": "ERR_CODE", "message": "Human text", "details": { ... }, "meta": { "source": "sleeper", "generatedAt": "ISO" } }
>    ```
>
>    Keep the partial 206 example as:
>
>    ```json
>    { "ok": false, "missing": ["players"], "meta": { ... }, "data": { ...context... } }
>    ```
> 3. **Cache metadata function** → Prefer `getPlayersCacheMeta()` in docs (mention `getCacheMetadata()` only as a temporary compatibility alias if it still exists).
> 4. **Performance** → Rephrase to “**Targets**: Cold 2–3s, Warm 50–200ms, Context 0.5–1.0s” and note that upstream latency may vary.
> 5. **Health behavior** → Note that when `USE_SLEEPER_SYNC=false`, `/api/sleeper/health` returns **503** with the same error contract (including `meta`).
> 6. **Test script** → Point to the hardened `test-sleeper-sync.sh` and its dynamic season logic.
>
> **Deliverable:** Updated summary/README markdown reflecting the above, plus a 1-paragraph “What changed vs. handoff” note.

## TL;DR for you

* Change the two bullets (season range + error `meta`) and we’re aligned.
* Prefer `getPlayersCacheMeta()` in all references.
* Call perf numbers “targets.”

Ship me the next thing if you want me to sanity-check the final README before it hits the repo.
