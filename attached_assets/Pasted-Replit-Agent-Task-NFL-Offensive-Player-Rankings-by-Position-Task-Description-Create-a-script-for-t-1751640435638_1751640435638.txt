Replit Agent Task: NFL Offensive Player Rankings by Position
Task Description: Create a script for the fantasy football app to rank NFL offensive players (QB, RB, WR, TE) using advanced analytics from APIs [e.g., nflverse, ESPN Public API, MySportsFeeds]. Integrate with the app’s real-time data sync for lineup/roster optimization.
Steps:
1.  API Integration: Connect to APIs (e.g., nfl_data_py for nflverse) with API keys.
2.  Data Retrieval: Fetch 2024 season player stats, advanced metrics, and game logs.
3.  Metric Calculation: Compute position-specific analytics (below). Normalize per game/snap.
4.  Ranking Logic: Generate composite score (e.g., weighted sum) per player. Rank by position.
5.  Output: Store rankings in app’s database. Export as JSON for integration.
Key Analytics by Position:
•  Quarterback (QB):
	•  Expected Points Added (EPA) per Play: Efficiency.
	•  Completion Percentage Over Expected (CPOE): Accuracy.
	•  Deep Pass Yards per Attempt: Big-play ability.
	•  Pressure-to-Sack Rate: Pocket presence.
•  Running Back (RB):
	•  Yards After Contact per Carry: Elusiveness.
	•  Rush EPA per Attempt: Run efficiency.
	•  Receiving Yards per Route Run: Pass-catching.
	•  Broken Tackle Rate: Physicality.
•  Wide Receiver (WR):
	•  Yards per Route Run: Efficiency.
	•  Target Share: Offensive involvement.
	•  Air Yards Share: Deep-threat ability.
	•  Contested Catch Rate: Reliability.
•  Tight End (TE):
	•  Yards per Route Run: Receiving efficiency.
	•  Red Zone Target Share: Scoring opportunity.
	•  Blocking Snap Percentage: Run-game contribution.
	•  Catch Rate Over Expected: Hands reliability.
Implementation Notes:
•  Use Python with nfl_data_py, pandas, requests.
•  Filter by minimum snaps (e.g., 100) or games (e.g., 8).
•  Handle missing data by excluding players or imputing averages.
•  Weight metrics (e.g., 40% EPA, 30% efficiency, 20% volume, 10% durability).
•  Sync with app’s database (per July 3, 2025 discussion) for ESPN/Yahoo/NFL platforms.
•  Test API: nfl.import_weekly_data(season=2024, columns=["player_id", "position", "epa"]).
Deliverable:
•  Script (nfl_offense_rankings.py):
	•  Pulls API data.
	•  Calculates metrics, ranks players.
	•  Stores in database.
	•  Outputs JSON (offense_rankings_2024.json).
•  Console: Top 10 players per position.
