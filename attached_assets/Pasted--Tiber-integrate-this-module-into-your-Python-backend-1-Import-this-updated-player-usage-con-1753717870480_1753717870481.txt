# 2. Append this to your dynasty backend file and trigger the update for:
# - Dynasty Tier Recalibrator
# - Roster Competition Estimator
# - Player Usage Forecast Module
# - OASIS Context Evaluator

# 3. Create or update frontend tier display route (minimal layout)
# Route: /2025-tier-view or integrate into existing Rankings UI
# Display by position:
# > WR Tier 1:
#     - Luther Burden
#     - Travis Hunter
#     - Emeka Egbuka
# > WR Tier 2:
#     - Chris Godwin

# 4. Future Integration Plan:
# ✔️ Monitor roster movement daily with ShiftListener
# ✔️ Feed high-impact changes into this usage module
# ✔️ Recalc alpha usage score and adjust tiers dynamically
