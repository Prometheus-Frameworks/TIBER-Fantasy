🔧 Task: Make FORGE the Official Rankings, Sandbox Internal Only

We’ve now promoted WR/RB rankings to /rankings/* using:
	•	AlphaRankingsLayout
	•	WRFormulaWeightsPanel
	•	RBFormulaWeightsPanel
	•	ForgeTransparencyPanel

Current issue:
The main WR/RB Rankings tables still show Sandbox α and Δ, which is confusing for users. We want the public-facing Rankings to be FORGE-only, with Sandbox + Δ available only as an internal/dev view.

⸻

1. WR/RB Rankings Tables → FORGE-Only in UI
In whatever component renders the actual table (likely ForgeRankingsTable or equivalent):
	•	For normal (non-dev) mode:
	•	Show columns:
	•	Rank
	•	Player
	•	Team
	•	Games
	•	FORGE α (calibrated)
	•	Trajectory
	•	Do NOT show:
	•	Sandbox α
	•	Δ

The Rankings page should visually present FORGE as the single official score.

2. Keep Sandbox α + Δ Behind a Dev Toggle
We still want Sandbox + Δ for our own analysis, but not for users.

Implementation:
	•	Add a dev flag at the top of WR/RB rankings pages:

const isDev =
  process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' ||
  import.meta.env.VITE_SHOW_SANDBOX === 'true';


	•	Only when isDev is true, render:
	•	Sandbox α column
	•	Δ column
	•	“Show big disagreements only” toggle
	•	In non-dev mode:
	•	Hide these columns and the disagreement toggle entirely.
	•	Keep the underlying logic in place (don’t delete it), just conditionally render.

This keeps all our comparison machinery intact for us, without confusing public users.

3. Keep Sliders Visible, Clarify Their Role
We do want to keep WRFormulaWeightsPanel and RBFormulaWeightsPanel visible in Rankings — they’re part of the identity.

But now that Sandbox α is hidden for users, clarify the text:
	•	Under WR sliders:
“These sliders power the Sandbox model used during development. The rankings below are generated by the FORGE engine, which uses its own internal features and calibration.”
	•	Under RB sliders (similar message):
“These weights describe how we think about RBs (volume, efficiency, role leverage, stability, context). FORGE uses a more complex internal formula, but this panel shows the philosophy behind it.”

Use existing typography / colors; no new styles.

4. ForgeTransparencyPanel Copy Update
Update ForgeTransparencyPanel for WR/RB so the language matches the new behavior:
	•	Emphasize:
	•	“Displayed rankings = FORGE α (calibrated).”
	•	“Sandbox is our internal tuning environment and may differ from what’s shown.”
	•	Make sure it no longer implies that users are seeing two competing scores.

Again, text-only change; don’t modify any styling.

5. Sanity Check After Changes
For both /rankings/wr and /rankings/rb:
	•	In normal mode:
	•	Table shows only FORGE α as the numeric rating.
	•	Sliders visible at top.
	•	Transparency panel explains the engine + data sources.
	•	No Sandbox α, no Δ, no “disagreements only” toggle.
	•	In dev mode (NODE_ENV !== ‘production’ or VITE_SHOW_SANDBOX=true):
	•	Sandbox α column appears again.
	•	Δ column appears again.
	•	“Show big disagreements only” checkbox works as before
