I've completed a comprehensive analysis of the Tiber project within the environment. Here's a recap of the key work I've performed to help you decide on the next steps:
1. Source Code Identification and Filtering
I began by systematically identifying the actual source code files for Tiber. This involved:
Scanning the entire directory for JavaScript and TypeScript files (.ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx).
Filtering out non-project directories (like node_modules, .local, pnpm) and Manus-generated reports to isolate the core application logic.
Generating a clean list of the project's primary source files for targeted analysis.
2. Deep-Dive Analysis of Core Components
I performed a detailed technical review of two foundational files that define Tiber's architecture:
Frontend (tiber_idp_lab_components.tsx): Analyzed the React 18 components for the IDP Lab. I documented the layout structure, the interactive filter system, and the various data visualization components (IDP Rankings, Defensive DNA, and the Havoc Index). I also noted the current use of mock data and the planned integration points for a live API.
Backend/Database (tiber_drizzle_migrations.ts): Examined the Drizzle ORM schema definitions. I identified the critical data models, including playerTraitVectors, schemeIntelligence, havocIndex, and various rookie-related tables, which form the analytical backbone of the platform.
3. Architectural and Functional Documentation
Based on the code analysis, I produced a comprehensive report that outlines:
The Technology Stack: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL.
System Integration Flow: How the frontend state and filter parameters are designed to interact with the backend database schema through a future API layer.
Key Analytical Metrics: Documentation of the purpose and data structures for unique features like the "Havoc Index" and "Defensive DNA."
4. Professional Presentation and Synthesis
I synthesized all these findings into a professional slide deck. This presentation highlights:
The modular and scalable design of the IDP Lab.
The robust, vector-based data modeling in the backend.
The clear separation of concerns that makes the project ready for full-scale API integration.
