Yep—classic “it’s done in code but the preview is serving yesterday’s bundle.” Two likely culprits: caching or you’re looking at a different build/route than the files you edited.

Here’s a fast, no-BS triage you can do in 5–10 minutes:

# 1) Prove the bundle is new

* In any visible component (e.g., WRCompass header), add a tiny marker like `v0.1.3` or an emoji.
* Refresh. If you don’t see it, you’re not loading the new bundle.

# 2) Kill client-side caching

* Open DevTools → Network → check **Disable cache** → hard reload (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R).
* Application tab → **Service Workers** → Unregister any SW.
* Application tab → **Clear storage** → Clear site data.

# 3) Make sure the *right* component is mounted

You’ve got both a page and a component named similarly.

* Confirm the route imports the updated one:

  * `pages/WRCompass.tsx` should import from `components/WRCompass.tsx` (the file you edited).
  * If there’s also a `pages/WRCompass.tsx` *duplicate* UI, your edits won’t show. Delete the dup or point the route to the component you patched.

# 4) Verify the dev/prod server you’re actually hitting

* If Express is serving a built client, you need to **rebuild** the client and restart the server.

  * `cd client && npm run build`
  * Ensure Express serves the **new** `client/dist`.
  * Restart the server process (stop/start, not just hot reload).
* If using Vite dev server proxy, make sure it’s the running target (ports match, HMR connected).

# 5) Stop serving stale `index.html`

Make sure the server sets cache headers:

```ts
// serve index.html as no-store so it always pulls fresh asset hashes
app.get('*', (req, res, next) => {
  res.set('Cache-Control', 'no-store');
  next();
});
```

Static assets can stay long-cached; `index.html` must not.

# 6) Add a version stamp so this never confuses you again

* Generate a build tag and show it in the UI footer:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
export default defineConfig({
  define: { __BUILD__: JSON.stringify(new Date().toISOString()) }
})
```

```tsx
// Footer.tsx
<span>build: {__BUILD__}</span>
```

# 7) One quick “is it the server?” test

Open DevTools → Network → reload:

* Look for `/assets/*.js`. Click one and check **Response Headers** → `Last-Modified` / content.
* If timestamps are old, you’re hitting an old build folder or a CDN cache. Rebuild + restart.

# 8) Tell Tiber exactly what to do (copy/paste)

> 1. Add a `BUILD_TAG` (ISO timestamp) via Vite `define` and render it in the site footer.
> 2. Ensure Express serves `index.html` with `Cache-Control: no-store`.
> 3. Remove any duplicate page components shadowing the updated components (WRCompass, RookieClass, Analytics). Ensure routes import the edited files.
> 4. Rebuild client (`npm run build`) and restart the server.
> 5. Post the commit diff and a screenshot showing the new build tag in the footer.

If after all that you still don’t see changes, send me:

* A screenshot of the Network tab (the main `index.html` + one `assets/*.js` request headers), and
* Your route file showing the WRCompass import.

We’ll nail it in one pass.
