got a trade eval im stuck on. want to help

T
Let's get right to it. To provide a useful trade evaluation, I need the specifics:

1.  **What are the exact trade details?** (Who is giving up what?)
2.  **What are your team's needs?** (What positions are you targeting?)

Without those, I can only offer general advice. But give me the trade details and I'll give you my unvarnished evaluation.

okay lets get into it. context: 12 team .5ppr redraft. currently 1st place / 12 @ 8-3. main objective: secure first place to get the bye week, allowing me to skip first week of playoffs (week 15). currently, my running backs are CMC, jaylen Warren, sean tucker, chris rodriguez, keaton mitchell and brian robinson to handcuff CMC. as you can see, it is 1 stud - CMC, jaylen warren who just picked up a potential injury, and then some high upside handcuffs to other NFL starters. my WR room is a bit better, including justin jefferson, rashee rice, tetairola mcmillan, emeka egbuka, jaylin noel, luther burden and calvin austin. at TE i have colston loveland and my QB is drake maye. are you ready for the trade proposal in question now that i have provided you with more context?

T
Yes, I'm ready. Given your 8-3 record, strong WRs, and QB situation, securing the bye week is the right move. I'm prepared to analyze the trade proposal with that context in mind. Let's hear it.

i send away Justin justin jefferson. i receive chris olave and woody marks. now, i do not like to trade away elite players like jefferson. but i think its fair given the current QB situation for the vikings. 

T
No. Do not trade Justin Jefferson for Chris Olave and Woody Marks.

Jefferson is WR20 with 8.7 PPG. In 2024, Jefferson had 103 receptions, 1533 receiving yards, and 10 TDs. He's a proven elite WR. Olave is WR18 with 8.8 PPG. Marks is unranked and has little proven value. Even with QB questions, Jefferson's talent outweighs the risk.

Keep the elite WR. Don't trade proven talent for unproven assets, even with QB uncertainty.
