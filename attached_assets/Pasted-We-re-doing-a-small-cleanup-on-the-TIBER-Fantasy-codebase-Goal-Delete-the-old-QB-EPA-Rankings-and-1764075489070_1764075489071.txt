We’re doing a small cleanup on the TIBER Fantasy codebase.

Goal:
Delete the old QB EPA Rankings and QB Stats Review widgets (front-end + back-end) because they’re legacy and the new QBRankingsSandbox.tsx fully replaces them.

FRONTEND TASKS

Search the entire client/ tree for these exact text strings:

"QB EPA Rankings"

"No EPA data available. Run the EPA calculation first."

"QB Stats Review"

"No QB data available"

"QB statistics are currently unavailable"

Identify the React components that render those headers/empty-state messages.
They are likely used inside AnalyticsPage.tsx, TiberDashboard.tsx, or a shared component file.

Do the following:

Remove those components entirely if they are dedicated UI blocks just for these QB EPA/QB Stats views.

If they’re inline sections inside a larger page, delete the entire JSX block that renders those cards/sections.

Remove any associated imports that become unused.

Make sure there is no remaining link/button/nav item that points to those views.

Confirm that:

QBRankingsSandbox.tsx is untouched.

No front-end code is still trying to call “QB EPA Rankings” or “QB Stats Review” endpoints.

BACKEND TASKS

The backend uses server/routes.ts as a main router plus additional routers in server/routes/.

Search server/ for any routes or functions clearly dedicated to the old QB EPA / QB stats views:

Likely patterns:

"qb-epa"

"qb_epa"

"qb-epa-rankings"

"qb-stats-review"

"qb_stats_review"

Or route descriptions mentioning “QB EPA” or “QB Stats Review”

For any endpoints that exist solely to feed those deleted front-end widgets, do the following:

Remove the route handler from server/routes.ts or from the relevant file in server/routes/.

Remove any service/module imports that are now unused (e.g. EPA calculation helpers, old QB stats loaders if nothing else uses them).

If an EPA calculation module is shared with other active features, keep the shared pieces but delete anything that’s only used by the old widgets.

Important:

Do NOT remove any endpoints used by QBRankingsSandbox.tsx.

If a route is used both by the sandbox and the old widgets, only remove the wiring that’s exclusively tied to the old components and keep whatever the sandbox actually calls.

After removal:

Run TypeScript build / tests or the project’s standard check command.

Fix any compilation issues related to missing imports or types.

Ensure no /api/* endpoint exists that is only for those dead QB EPA / QB stats views.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

There is no UI anywhere in the app that shows:

“QB EPA Rankings”

“No EPA data available. Run the EPA calculation first.”

“QB Stats Review”

“No QB data available”

Navigation and dashboards have no dead links or blank QB cards.

QBRankingsSandbox.tsx remains the primary QB evaluation UI and still works.

The server routes file(s) contain no endpoints whose sole purpose was feeding these old views.

Please summarize:

Which components/files you removed or modified.

Which backend routes were removed or cleaned up.

Any shared utilities that were kept because they’re used elsewhere.
