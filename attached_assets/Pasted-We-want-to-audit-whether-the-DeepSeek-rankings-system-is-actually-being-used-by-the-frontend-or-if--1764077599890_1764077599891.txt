We want to audit whether the DeepSeek rankings system is actually being used by the frontend, or if it’s effectively dead.

This is an audit only task.
Do NOT delete or modify anything yet.

1) Backend Side – rankingsV3 Routes

Focus file:

server/routes/rankingsV3.ts

Confirm and document:

All endpoints it exposes, including:

GET /api/rankings/deepseek/v3

GET /api/rankings/deepseek/v3.1

GET /api/rankings/deepseek/v3.2

Any /health, /audit, /debug variants

How it’s mounted in server/routes.ts

e.g. app.use('/api', rankingsV3Router);

Any other backend code that imports or calls functions from rankingsV3 or its services.

Return a short summary of the backend setup.

2) Frontend Side – Where Is “DeepSeek” Used?

Search the entire client/ directory for anything related to DeepSeek:

Search terms (case-insensitive):

deepseek

"/api/rankings/deepseek

v3.1

v3.2

useDeepseekV3

For each match, report:

File path

How it is used:

Is it an imported hook?

A direct fetch/axios call?

A tab definition or config entry?

A type/interface only?

Specifically, inspect:

client/src/hooks/useDeepseekV3.ts (if it exists)

What endpoints does it call?

Is this hook used anywhere?

client/src/pages/TiberDashboard.tsx

client/src/pages/LeadersPage.tsx

Any pages/components with names like:

Rankings

Deepseek

Fusion

Quadrant

For each frontend match, indicate whether the DeepSeek data is:

Rendered in the UI (tables, lists, cards, etc.)

Or only defined but never actually used.

3) Determine Usage Status

Based on your findings, classify the DeepSeek rankings system as one of:

CORE_ACTIVE

Actively powering one or more visible UI surfaces (pages, tabs, cards, etc.)

PARTIALLY_ACTIVE

Hook or API is wired up and fetches data, but only used in a limited or experimental way.

WIRED_BUT_UNUSED

Hook exists and calls the API, but nothing actually uses the hook’s output for rendering.

DEAD

No frontend calls at all, no real usage.

For each classification, give a one–sentence justification.

4) Output Format

Return the results in structured markdown like this:

## Backend – rankingsV3.ts
- Endpoints:
  - GET /api/rankings/deepseek/v3 → ...
  - ...
- Mounted: (show how in server/routes.ts)
- Other backend usages: (if any)

## Frontend – DeepSeek Usage

### client/src/hooks/useDeepseekV3.ts
- Calls: (list endpoints)
- Used by: (list files or "no usages found")

### Other Matches
- client/src/pages/____.tsx – describes usage
- client/src/components/____.tsx – describes usage

## Classification
- Status: DEAD / WIRED_BUT_UNUSED / PARTIALLY_ACTIVE / CORE_ACTIVE
- Justification: (one sentence)


Do not modify or delete any code in this pass.
This is strictly usage detection so we can decide whether to remove or refactor DeepSeek later.
