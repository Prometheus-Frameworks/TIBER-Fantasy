TIBER.AI — Implement Codex patch: Metric Matrix Player Vector + UI card

GOAL
Add a Metric Matrix “player vector” service (deterministic axes JSON) with caching table, route, and a PlayerDetailDrawer UI card rendering horizontal axis bars w/ confidence.

RULES
- Do NOT overwrite existing logic. Only add or minimally modify touched files.
- Keep type safety. Ensure builds pass.
- If any naming differs in existing codebase, adapt imports/paths accordingly.

TASKS
1) Add new doc file:
- docs/metric-matrix/axis_map.json (as provided)

2) Add migration:
- migrations/0010_metric_matrix_player_vectors.sql
IMPORTANT: Make season and week NOT NULL to match the PRIMARY KEY.
Example:
  season integer NOT NULL,
  week integer NOT NULL
If you must support defaults, use DEFAULT 0.

3) Update Drizzle schema:
- shared/schema.ts
Add metricMatrixPlayerVectors table definition.
IMPORTANT: season/week should be .notNull() if they’re in the PK.

4) Add service module:
- server/modules/metricMatrix/playerVectorService.ts
Ensure imports match project structure:
- db from server/infra/db
- weeklyStats/playerUsage/metricMatrixPlayerVectors from shared/schema

5) Add routes:
- server/routes/metricMatrixRoutes.ts with GET /player-vector
Validate query with zod (playerId required; season/week optional; mode default "forge")
Return JSON { success: true, data }

6) Mount router:
- server/routes.ts
app.use('/api/metric-matrix', metricMatrixRoutes);

7) Frontend UI:
- client/src/components/PlayerDetailDrawer.tsx
Add a “Metric Matrix” card that fetches:
  /api/metric-matrix/player-vector?playerId=<id>&season=<season>&week=<week>
Render 5 axis bars + confidence badge.
IMPORTANT: Fix TS typing by importing ReactNode:
  import { useState, type ReactNode } from 'react';
and replace React.ReactNode with ReactNode.

TEST
- Run migration / restart server
- curl:
  curl "http://localhost:5000/api/metric-matrix/player-vector?playerId=<PLAYER_ID>&season=2025&week=3"
- Open Player Detail Drawer and confirm:
  - Card renders bars
  - Confidence shows a %
  - Graceful fallback on error

DELIVERABLE
Commit the changes with message:
"Metric Matrix player vector endpoint + UI card"
