Title: Fix Metric Matrix: treat NULL usage shares as missing (not zero)

Prompt:
Implement a data-quality fix in server/modules/metricMatrix/playerVectorService.ts so NULL snap_share_pct (and other share fields) do not get coerced to 0.

Background

In player_usage, snap_share_pct is NULL for many players/weeks. Current vector computation uses u.snapSharePct ?? 0, which converts missing data into zeros and incorrectly crushes usage and context axes (snap_share_pct and role_security components show 0 instead of null/missing). We want missing data to behave as missing: surface in missingInputs, reduce confidence, and use axis defaults.

Requirements

Update deriveRawMetrics():

Compute avgSnapShare using only rows where snapSharePct != null.

If there are no non-null rows, avgSnapShare must be null (not 0).

Values in DB are 0–100 percentages, so if non-null: mean / 100 to convert to 0–1.

Compute avgTargetShare using only rows where targetSharePct != null (same pattern).

If none, return null.

Keep /100 conversion.

Update recentTrend:

Use only non-null snapSharePct rows when calculating the delta.

If fewer than 2 non-null points, return null.

Ensure rawMetrics.role_security mirrors avgSnapShare (so it becomes null when snap share missing).

Do NOT add “auto scaling detection” logic in normalization. Keep existing normalize rules.

Add/adjust unit tests (in the Metric Matrix test suite) to prove:

When snapSharePct is NULL across weeks, snap_share_pct component becomes null, missingInputs includes snap_share_pct, and confidence < 1.

target_share_pct remains correct for values like 21.74 (i.e., normalized output ~21.74, not clamped to 100).

Run tests:

npm run test:forge

Metric Matrix unit tests (the 159 suite)

npm run audit:metric-matrix

Expected outcome

For Ja’Marr Chase 2025 week 3:

snap_share_pct should no longer show 0 if DB is NULL.

missingInputs should include snap_share_pct (and role_security if derived from it).

confidence should drop accordingly.

usage/context axis values should rise to defaults rather than being crushed.
