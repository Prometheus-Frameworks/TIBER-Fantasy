Week 1 Fantasy Football Risers and Fallers (2025)
Week 1 delivered plenty of surprises, from rookie explosions to veteran rebounds and backfield shakeups. Based on performances, snap shares, and emerging roles, here’s a breakdown of key risers (players whose stock is up for fantasy managers) and fallers (those seeing a dip). I’ve incorporated your suggested risers and expanded with notable fallers, focusing on dynasty and redraft implications where relevant.
Risers
These players boosted their value with strong usage, efficiency, or opportunity in Week 1.
	•	Juwan Johnson, TE, New Orleans Saints Showed reliable target volume in a low-scoring game (20-13 loss to Arizona), catching 5 passes for 58 yards. His red-zone looks could make him a streaming option in TE-scarce leagues, especially if the Saints’ offense rebounds.
	•	Isaac TeSlaa, WR, Detroit Lions Impressed in limited snaps with a 93.6 PFF receiving grade and a fourth-quarter TD catch in a 27-13 loss to Green Bay. As a rookie, his efficiency (top among Lions pass-catchers) signals potential flex upside if injuries hit the WR room.
	•	Harold Fannin Jr., TE, Cleveland Browns Emerged as a surprise volume hog with a 72% snap share, 9 targets, and 7 catches for 63 yards (plus a gadget carry) in a 17-16 loss to Cincinnati. As a fourth-round rookie behind David Njoku, his immediate impact boosts his dynasty value. 33 32 
	•	Jordan Addison, WR, Minnesota Vikings Currently suspended for three games, but his stock could rise upon return if J.J. McCarthy’s debut chemistry with receivers translates. Pre-suspension hype positions him as a WR2 with upside in a pass-heavy offense. 23 
	•	Bhayshul Tuten, RB, Jacksonville Jaguars With Tank Bigsby traded away, Tuten saw complementary touches behind Travis Etienne Jr., including a few explosive runs in a 26-10 win over Carolina. His speed could carve out a change-of-pace role, especially in PPR formats.
	•	J.J. McCarthy, QB, Minnesota Vikings Engineered a fourth-quarter comeback in his debut (27-24 win over Chicago), accounting for three TDs in the final period. His poise and mobility make him a dynasty stash with QB1 potential.
	•	Jordan Mason, RB, Minnesota Vikings Surged in the second half with 68 yards on 15 carries, helping fuel the comeback win. If he maintains this efficiency, he could challenge for more snaps in a committee.
	•	Elic Ayomanor, WR, Undetermined Team Flashed in limited action with big-play potential (specific team context unclear from Week 1, but early reports highlight his route-running as a rookie riser for deeper leagues).
	•	Jaxson Dart, QB, New York Giants As a rookie backup, showed flashes in mop-up duty. With Russell Wilson struggling, Dart could seize the QB1 job in a few weeks, offering dual-threat upside for dynasty rosters.
	•	Cedric Tillman, WR, Cleveland Browns Benefited from a pass-heavy script with 4 catches for 52 yards. If the Browns’ receiver depth remains thin, his size and contested-catch ability could lead to more targets.
	•	Dylan Sampson, RB, Cleveland Browns Versatile rookie debut with 29 rushing yards and 8 receptions for 64 yards in the loss to Cincinnati. His receiving work boosts PPR value in a backfield that could rotate.
	•	Travis Etienne Jr., RB, Jacksonville Jaguars Reclaimed bell-cow status with 16 carries for 143 yards (8.9 YPC), a 71-yard run, and 3 catches for 13 yards (18.6 PPR points). Explosive in Liam Coen’s system, he’s back to RB1 territory. 33 32 3 
	•	Emeka Egbuka, WR, Tampa Bay Buccaneers Rookie star with 4 catches for 64 yards, 2 TDs, and a 9-yard carry (23.6 PPR points) in a 23-20 win over Atlanta. With Chris Godwin fading, he’s a WR2 riser. 33 32 
	•	Jacory Croskey-Merritt, RB, Washington Commanders Led the backfield post-Brian Robinson Jr. trade with 10 carries for 82 yards (8.2 YPC) and a TD in a 21-6 win over the Giants. Explosive with 50% of RB carries. 33 
	•	Keon Coleman, WR, Buffalo Bills Big debut with 8 catches for 112 yards and a TD (25.2 PPR points) on 11 targets in a 41-40 thriller over Baltimore. High-upside WR3 with Josh Allen. 33 34 
	•	Tyler Warren, TE, Indianapolis Colts Dominant rookie with 7 catches on 9 targets for 76 yards and strong blocking in a 33-8 win over Miami. Elite TE upside. 34 
	•	Daniel Jones, QB, Indianapolis Colts Efficient debut with 22/29 for 272 yards, 1 passing TD, and 2 rushing TDs. Clean play signals a bounce-back. 32 5 
	•	Justin Fields, QB, New York Jets Dual-threat star with 16/22 for 218 yards, 1 passing TD, 48 rush yards, and 2 rushing TDs. Top QB scorer potential. 34 
Fallers
Players who underperformed, saw reduced roles, or faced concerning trends.
	•	Ashton Jeanty, RB, Las Vegas Raiders Inefficient debut with 21 touches for just 2.0 YPC and minimal receiving work (1.0 YPR) in a 20-13 win over New England. Limited red-zone looks hurt his first-round hype. 34 3 
	•	Kaleb Johnson, RB, Pittsburgh Steelers Buried on the depth chart with just 2 snaps and 1 carry for -2 yards in a 34-32 win over the Jets. Behind Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell. 33 32 
	•	De’Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins Limited to 7 carries for 55 yards and 3 catches for 20 yards (with a TD) in a 33-8 loss to Indianapolis. Negative game script and committee concerns tank his stock. 32 33 5 
	•	Jaylen Waddle, WR, Miami Dolphins Quiet with 3 catches for 30 yards in the blowout loss. Poor protection led to short throws; role questions arise. 32 
	•	Kenneth Walker III, RB, Seattle Seahawks Disappointing 10 carries for 20 yards and 3 catches for 4 yards in a 17-13 loss to San Francisco. Timeshare with Zach Charbonnet emerging. 33 
	•	Chuba Hubbard, RB, Carolina Panthers 3.6 YPC in a 26-10 loss to Jacksonville; pass-heavy second half limited efficiency as lead back. 32 
	•	Bryce Young, QB, Carolina Panthers Struggled with 18/35 for 154 yards, 1 TD, 2 INTs, and a fumble. Turnover-prone outing echoes past issues. 33 
	•	Jaydon Blue, RB, Dallas Cowboys Inactive for Week 1, while Javonte Williams scored twice. Early contribution doubts. 33 
	•	Joe Burrow, QB, Cincinnati Bengals (and offense) Bengals managed just 17 points in a win over Cleveland; Burrow had 14/113 passing yards. Slow start for the unit. 34 
	•	Tua Tagovailoa, QB, Miami Dolphins 114 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT in the rout; entire offense (including Tyreek Hill and Waddle) underwhelmed. 33 
This list highlights immediate impacts, but monitor Week 2 for trends. If you want to dive deeper on a specific player or add more context for Tiber, let me know!
