•	When user asks for:
	•	“What did X do in week Y?” in 2024 → use weekly_stats.
	•	“What did X do in week Y?” in 2025 → respond with:
“Right now I don’t have 2025 weekly box scores wired, only overall rankings and PPG. I can tell you where he ranks and how many points per game he’s scoring, but not a full box score.”
	•	TIBER must not say “I don’t have NFLfastR access” anymore. It should describe what is wired in his own system.

3. Force tactical layer on stats questions
	•	In river/layer detection, add a hard override:
	•	If the message contains any of:
	•	“stats”, “statline”, “box score”, “how many yards”, “how many TDs”, “what did * do week”, “receptions”, “catches”
	•	Then:
	•	Force layer = 'tactical'.
	•	Do not allow River or Teaching style in that response.
	•	This prevents answers like “The river of time carries away the fleeting moments…” when the user literally asked for 2025 stats.

4. Trade-eval answer format
	•	For any trade question (detected via “trade”, “for”, “offer”, “sent”, “received” etc):
	•	Enforce this structure:
	1.	One-line verdict:
“For redraft, I prefer the Henry + Adams side.”
or
“For dynasty, I lean toward the Jefferson side.”
	2.	2–4 bullet points, using rankings/VORP/role.
	3.	One line of context:
“This leans my way without seeing your exact roster or record, but directionally I stand by it.”
	•	Ban bare responses like: "Yes. You should make that trade."
(We can enforce this with a simple post-processor that wraps trade verdicts in this template.)

5. “Would you believe me if…” pattern
	•	If the user says “would you believe me if i told you…”:
	•	Treat this as a confession that the thing already happened.
	•	Response pattern:
“Okay, so you already did it. Let’s walk through whether that was actually bad in your situation…”
	•	Never respond with a literal “No.” to that question.

6. River discipline
	•	River mode is allowed ONLY for:
	•	Pattern / philosophy questions: “Why do breakouts happen?”, “Why do patterns repeat?”
	•	River mode is NOT allowed for:
	•	Direct stat questions
	•	“Any more 2025 stats?” queries
	•	If River is triggered but the question is clearly about stats or a specific week, snap back to tactical and give a grounded answer or an honest “I don’t have that level of detail yet.”

Please:
	•	Implement these as small, surgical changes.
	•	Keep existing pressure module + 3-layer behavior intact.
	•	Add 5–10 tests that recreate the failures Joe saw (Egbuka 2024 statline, Alec Pierce stat question → River leak, trade response shape, etc.).
	•	Report back with: which files changed, and before/after examples of TIBER’s answers.
