markdown# Tiber Fantasy - Pre-Launch Build Plan

## Context
- No existing users to migrate
- Building from scratch as "Tiber Fantasy"  
- Single unified dashboard experience
- Launch-ready in 6-8 weeks

## Immediate Tasks (This Week)

### 1. Finalize Dashboard Structure
Use the Tiber Dashboard artifact I created as the foundation:
- Sidebar navigation with 6 tabs
- Top nav bar with search/profile
- Home page with hero + stats cards
- Dark mode design system

### 2. Consolidate Existing Code
Instead of "migrating" features, just organize them into the right tabs:
client/src/
├── pages/
│   └── TiberDashboard.tsx          (Single entry point)
├── components/
│   ├── tabs/
│   │   ├── HomeTab.tsx             (Dashboard home)
│   │   ├── RankingsTab.tsx         (Power rankings)
│   │   ├── MatchupsTab.tsx         (DvP matchups)
│   │   ├── StrategyTab.tsx         (Compass, SOS)
│   │   ├── MovesTab.tsx            (Trade tools)
│   │   └── LeaguesTab.tsx          (Coming soon)
│   └── shared/
│       ├── PlayerCard.tsx
│       ├── StatCard.tsx
│       └── LoadingState.tsx

### 3. API Consolidation (Optional)
Can keep existing `/api/rankings`, `/api/dvp` endpoints OR
Create unified `/api/tiber/*` namespace - your choice, no users to break!

### 4. Remove Any Old/Unused Code
Since we're pre-launch, delete anything not being used:
- Old experimental pages
- Unused components
- Dead code paths
- Test/demo routes

## Build Priority

**P0 (Must have for launch):**
- ✅ Home tab (hero, stats, quick actions)
- ✅ Rankings tab (with real API data)
- ✅ Matchups tab (DvP working)
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling

**P1 (Should have):**
- ⚡ Strategy tab (Compass + SOS)
- ⚡ Moves tab (Trade analyzer)
- ⚡ Search functionality
- ⚡ Player comparison

**P2 (Nice to have):**
- 🌟 Leagues tab
- 🌟 Trends analysis
- 🌟 User accounts
- 🌟 Notifications

## Success Criteria

Before launch, verify:
- [ ] All P0 features working
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Page loads in <2s
- [ ] Works on mobile (test iPhone/Android)
- [ ] All API calls succeed
- [ ] Proper error messages if APIs fail
- [ ] SEO meta tags set up
- [ ] Analytics tracking ready (if using)

## Next Steps

1. Start with the TiberDashboard artifact as base
2. Copy existing Rankings/DvP logic into tabs
3. Wire up APIs with React Query
4. Test thoroughly
5. Deploy!

No migration complexity - just build it clean! 🎉
