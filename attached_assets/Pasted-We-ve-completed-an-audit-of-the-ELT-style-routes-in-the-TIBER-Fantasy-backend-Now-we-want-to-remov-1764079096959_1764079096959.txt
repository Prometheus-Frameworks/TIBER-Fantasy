We’ve completed an audit of the ELT-style routes in the TIBER Fantasy backend.

Now we want to remove the old Bronze/Silver/Gold route layers and the unused inline hot-list routes, while keeping all active features intact.

This is a delete + cleanup task.

1) Delete Bronze/Silver/Gold Route Files

Delete the following files from server/routes/:

server/routes/bronzeLayerRoutes.ts

server/routes/silverLayerRoutes.ts

server/routes/goldLayerRoutes.ts

These were classified as:

bronzeLayerRoutes.ts → DEAD/TEST_ONLY, not mounted

goldLayerRoutes.ts → DEAD/TEST_ONLY, not mounted

silverLayerRoutes.ts → LEGACY_UNUSED, admin-only, no frontend usage

After deletion, confirm these files no longer exist in the repo.

2) Remove Their Imports and Mounts in server/routes.ts

Open server/routes.ts and:

Remove any imports for the deleted route files, such as:

import bronzeLayerRoutes from './routes/bronzeLayerRoutes';
import silverLayerRoutes from './routes/silverLayerRoutes';
import goldLayerRoutes from './routes/goldLayerRoutes';


Remove any mounts/registrations, including (but not limited to):

app.use('/api/bronze', bronzeLayerRoutes);
app.use('/api/silver', silverLayerRoutes);
app.use('/api/gold', goldLayerRoutes);


Confirm there are no remaining references to these routers (bronzeLayerRoutes, silverLayerRoutes, goldLayerRoutes) anywhere in server/routes.ts or the rest of the codebase.

3) Delete Inline Hot-List Routes in server/routes.ts

In server/routes.ts, locate the inline hot-list handler block around lines 3892–4134 (previous audit range), which defines routes like:

GET /api/players/hot-list

GET /api/players/hot-list/health

POST /api/players/hot-list/mode/live

GET /api/players/hot-list/sources

POST /api/players/hot-list/refresh

This block:

Implements a “hot list” API

Is NOT used by the frontend

Conceptually overlaps with TIBER breakout logic

Do the following:

Delete the entire block of route handlers related to /api/players/hot-list*.

Remove any imports that were only used by these routes, such as:

hotListService

LiveDataProcessor

DataCaptureService

Any sample/hardcoded data utilities used only for hot-list

Confirm there are no remaining references to /api/players/hot-list anywhere in the repo.

4) Preserve Active Data/Analytics Systems

Do NOT modify or delete any of the following:

server/routes/analyticsRoutes.ts

server/routes/redraftWeeklyRoutes.ts

server/routes/ovrRoutes.ts

server/routes/strategyRoutes.ts

server/routes/matchupRoutes.ts

server/routes/weeklyTakesRoutes.ts

Any Compass routes (e.g. compassQbRoute.ts, compassWrRoute.ts, etc.)

Any sandbox pages/routes (WR/RB/TE/QB sandboxes)

Any TIBER routes: tiberRoutes.ts, tiberDataRoutes.ts, tiberMemoryRoutes.ts

We are only removing the legacy ELT route layer (Bronze/Silver/Gold) and the unused hot-list block.
All active analytics, rankings, sandboxes, and strategy systems must stay intact.

Also do not touch any ETL services that are still imported by active modules. Only delete services if they become unused (see next step).

5) Optional: Clean Up Any Now-Orphaned ELT Services

After deleting the routes and hot-list block:

Search for any services that were used only by Bronze/Silver/Gold or the /api/players/hot-list routes (e.g. bronzeLayerService, silverLayerService, goldLayerService, or hot-list specific services).

If a service is no longer imported anywhere in the codebase after this route deletion:

You may delete that service file as well.

If a service is still imported by active modules (e.g. core analytics, projections, or TIBER logic):

Leave the service in place.

If you remove any such service files, ensure that:

All imports referring to them are also removed

The app still builds and runs cleanly

6) Run Build / Type-Check and Fix Fallout

After all deletions and cleanup:

Run the project’s usual build / type-check command.

Fix any errors related to:

Missing imports from deleted route files

Missing services that you removed

Unused imports that can now be safely deleted

Goal: zero TypeScript/compile errors, and no runtime crashes.

7) Final Verification Checklist

Confirm the following:

bronzeLayerRoutes.ts, silverLayerRoutes.ts, and goldLayerRoutes.ts are fully deleted.

The inline hot-list routes under /api/players/hot-list* no longer exist in server/routes.ts.

There are no imports or app.use(...) calls for these routes in server/routes.ts.

The app starts successfully on port 5000 (or the usual configured port).

Existing core features still work as expected:

OVR ratings

TIBER Dashboard tabs

Analytics/Leaders pages

Redraft weekly stats views

Strategy tab

Matchup ROS endpoints

Weekly Takes tab

8) Report Back

When finished, please provide a summary including:

List of files deleted

List of import/mount lines removed from server/routes.ts

Any additional service files deleted (if applicable)

Confirmation that the app builds and runs successfully

Confirmation that no /api/bronze/*, /api/silver/*, /api/gold/*, or /api/players/hot-list* endpoints exist anymore
