  "description": "Evaluates a player's opportunity based on surrounding target threats. Not just for rookies — this applies to all WRs, TEs, and RBs receiving work.",
  "usage_scope": "Universal (Rookie + Veteran)",
  "scoring_tiers": {
    "S": "Clear alpha. Little to no significant competition (e.g., Travis Kelce pre-2023).",
    "A": "High-end target share expected. Maybe 1 serious threat but likely 25%+ share.",
    "B": "Starter in a healthy rotation. Competitive room (e.g., Pittman in 3-WR heavy team).",
    "C": "Strong competition likely lowers ceiling. Target share capped under 18%.",
    "D": "Buried or unclear role. Unlikely to command reliable usage."
  },
  "factors_considered": [
    "Red zone usage overlap",
    "Role competition (e.g., slot-only player competing with elite slot WR)",
    "High target-earning teammates (top 24 WRs/TEs)",
    "Incoming rookie threats or breakout candidates",
    "Departures that open opportunity (vacated targets)",
    "RBs with high route participation (e.g., Achane, Ekeler)"

  "tiber_instruction": "Use this logic to rate *any* WR/TE/RB player. Update scores as depth charts shift. Pull from game logs and player profiles to adjust tier. Cross-reference teammates for target overlap and red zone conflict. TCS must affect player projection and final Dynasty Tier scores."
