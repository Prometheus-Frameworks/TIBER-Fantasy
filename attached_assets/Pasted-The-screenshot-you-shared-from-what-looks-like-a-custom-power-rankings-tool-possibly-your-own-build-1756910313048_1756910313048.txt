The screenshot you shared from what looks like a custom power rankings tool (possibly your own build, given the “/power-rankings” URL) does indeed show a sharp drop-off after the top three, with mismatched players like Avery Williams (who’s primarily a defensive back and return specialist for the Falcons, not a Phillies RB—wait, PHI might be a team mislabel, as he’s ATL) and backups like Pierre Strong and Tyler Allgeier popping up too high with oddly low scores. That suggests a potential issue in data ingestion, player classification, or the scoring algorithm—maybe it’s only fully processing starters or has a threshold bug where secondary metrics tank the ratings.
To align with your goal for Tiber (assuming that’s the system or bot you’re developing), here’s how to structure it for reliable, data-driven power rankings that evolve weekly:
1. Sourcing Appropriate Data Resources
Tiber needs real-time access to NFL player stats, projections, and historical performance. Key sources include:
	•	Weekly Stats: NFL.com for rushing/receiving yards, TDs, fumbles, etc. (e.g., browse pages like nfl.com/stats/player-stats/category/rushing/2025/REG/all).
	•	Fantasy Projections and Rankings: Sites like ESPN, FantasyPros, NFL.com, or Draft Sharks for consensus ECR (Expert Consensus Rankings) and projected points.
	•	Advanced Metrics: Pro Football Focus (PFF) or Next Gen Stats for signals like yards after contact, broken tackles, route participation, or snap counts—these are “signals” that indicate relevancy beyond raw numbers (e.g., a RB with high yards per carry but low volume might be a breakout candidate).
	•	APIs for Automation: If building programmatically, use free/public APIs like NFL’s official one (nfl.com/api) or third-party like Sleeper’s API for fantasy-specific data. Avoid scraping if possible to comply with terms.
Fetch data post-week (e.g., Tuesdays after Monday Night Football) to capture full results.
2. Detecting Signals in Data for Relevancy
To “see signals” that translate to power rankings, implement a multi-factor model:
	•	Basic Fantasy Scoring: Calculate points from stats (standard: 0.1 pts/yard rushing/receiving, 6 pts/TD, -2 pts/fumble, bonuses for PPR receptions).
	•	Advanced Signals:
	◦	Efficiency: Yards per carry (YPC > 4.5 signals elite), success rate (positive EPA per play).
	◦	Volume/Opportunity: Snap share (>60% for RB1), touches per game (>15), red-zone usage.
	◦	Team Context: O-line strength (via PFF grades), schedule difficulty, injury backups.
	◦	Trending: Weighted recent performance (e.g., 70% last week, 30% season avg) to spot hot streaks like your CMC example.
	•	Algorithm Suggestion: Use a weighted score = (0.4 * Projected Points) + (0.3 * Recent Performance) + (0.2 * Efficiency Metrics) + (0.1 * Team/Health Factors). Rank players by this score to avoid cliffs—normalize to 100-scale if desired.
	•	If using ML (e.g., via PyTorch in code), train on historical data to predict next-week points, inputting signals like the above.
For your CMC hypothetical: 200 rush yards + 2 TDs = ~32 fantasy points (high-end RB1 output). Tiber would boost his score/rank by factoring this into trends, potentially jumping him from preseason ~RB4 to RB1 if others underperform, while scaling down volume-dependent backs like Henry if they had low-output games.
Weekly Diagnosis and Translation to Rankings
Set Tiber to run post-week:
	•	Pull stats/projections.
	•	Compute scores.
	•	Output ranked list with explanations (e.g., “CMC up to #1: Elite efficiency + volume in Week 1”). This keeps it dynamic—preseason rankings are baseline, then adjust based on real games.
Since we’re pre-Week 1 (season kicks off tomorrow, Sept 4), here’s a compiled preseason consensus top 30 RB power rankings for 2025, averaged from major sources. I prioritized PPR formats (common for modern fantasy) and focused on redraft/redzone upside. This avoids the cliff in your screenshot by drawing from broad data. 16 14 13 1 5 Notes: Rookies like Jeanty and Irving are rising on hype; vets like CMC and Kamara have injury/age dings but high ceilings.
	1	Bijan Robinson (ATL) – Explosive all-purpose back in a revamped offense.
	2	Jahmyr Gibbs (DET) – Dual-threat speedster with increasing workload.
	3	Saquon Barkley (PHI) – Monster 2024 carryover behind elite O-line.
	4	Derrick Henry (BAL) – Goal-line king, still dominant at volume.
	5	Ashton Jeanty (LV) – Rookie sensation with college dominance translating fast.
	6	Christian McCaffrey (SF) – Versatile stud, but monitoring workload post-injuries.
	7	Jonathan Taylor (IND) – Healthy and primed for bounce-back.
	8	De’Von Achane (MIA) – Electric efficiency, shares backfield but high upside.
	9	Josh Jacobs (GB) – Reliable workhorse in run-friendly scheme.
	10	Bucky Irving (TB) – Pass-catching specialist emerging as lead.
	11	Chase Brown (CIN) – Breakout candidate with expanded role.
	12	Kyren Williams (LAR) – Proven volume hog.
	13	James Cook (BUF) – Solid RB2 with receiving chops, but not elite rusher.
	14	Breece Hall (NYJ) – Talent meets opportunity with better QB play.
	15	James Conner (ARI) – TD machine if healthy.
	16	Alvin Kamara (NO) – PPR gold, but suspension/age risks.
	17	Kenneth Walker III (SEA) – Boom-or-bust rusher with big-play ability.
	18	David Montgomery (DET) – Gibbs’ complement, goal-line vulture.
	19	TreVeyon Henderson (NE) – Rookie with three-down potential.
	20	Isiah Pacheco (KC) – Mahomes’ RB, efficiency improving.
	21	Aaron Jones (MIN) – Veteran speed, but sharing with Mason.
	22	D’Andre Swift (CHI) – Versatile in new offense.
	23	Chuba Hubbard (CAR) – Lead back by default, steady floor.
	24	Tony Pollard (TEN) – Speedy option in committee.
	25	Omarion Hampton (LAC) – Rookie upside in Harbaugh’s run game.
	26	Travis Etienne Jr. (JAX) – Volume king, but fumble issues.
	27	Kaleb Johnson (PIT) – Power back fitting Tomlin’s style.
	28	Tyrone Tracy Jr. (NYG) – Pass-game role boosting value.
	29	Austin Ekeler (WSH) – PPR specialist, rebound candidate.
	30	Jaylen Warren (PIT) – Efficient backup with standalone flex appeal.
If this is for your app, test by inputting mock Week 1 data (like your CMC scenario) and ensure the algo scales smoothly—no arbitrary cutoffs. If you share more details on Tiber’s current setup (e.g., scoring formula or data feed), I can refine suggestions or even simulate fixes via code. Once Week 1 hits, ping me for updated rankings—I can pull fresh data.
