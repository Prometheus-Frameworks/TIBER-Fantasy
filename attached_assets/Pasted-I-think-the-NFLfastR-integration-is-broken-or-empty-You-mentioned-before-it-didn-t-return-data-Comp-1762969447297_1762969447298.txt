I think the NFLfastR integration is broken or empty. You mentioned before it didn't return data.Comprehensive NFLfastR System Audit Needed:Step 1: Verify Package Installation
pythonimport nfl_data_py as nfl

# Test basic functionality
print(nfl.__version__)

# Try loading 2025 season data
pbp_2025 = nfl.import_pbp_data([2025])
print(f"Rows returned: {len(pbp_2025)}")
print(f"Columns: {pbp_2025.columns.tolist()}")Expected: Should return thousands of rows with dozens of columns
If empty: 2025 data not available yet OR package not workingStep 2: Test Player-Specific Query
python# Query Josh Jacobs' 2025 rushing data
jacobs_plays = pbp_2025[
    (pbp_2025['rusher_player_name'] == 'J.Jacobs') &
    (pbp_2025['season'] == 2025)
]

print(f"Jacobs rushing attempts: {len(jacobs_plays)}")
print(f"Total yards: {jacobs_plays['yards_gained'].sum()}")
print(f"YPC: {jacobs_plays['yards_gained'].mean()}")Expected: Should return actual 2025 stats
If empty: Player name matching broken OR no dataStep 3: Check Available Metrics
python# What fields are actually populated?
for col in pbp_2025.columns:
    non_null = pbp_2025[col].notna().sum()
    print(f"{col}: {non_null} non-null values")This shows: Which metrics have data vs which are emptyStep 4: Test Validation Service
bashcurl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/nflfastr/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jargon_term": "yards_per_carry",
    "player_or_team": "J.Jacobs", 
    "season": 2025
  }'Expected: Should return actual YPC
If error/null: Service broken or data missingStep 5: Document Available Fields
Create mapping of what NFLfastR actually has vs what we THOUGHT it had:Available ✅:
- yards_gained
- success rate
- epa
- [list all populated fields]

Missing ❌:
- snap_share (need to derive or get from other source)
- route_participation (need NextGenStats)
- [list unavailable fields]After audit, update jargon dictionary to mark which metrics are actually queryable vs theoretical.Goal: Know exactly what granular data TIBER can access. If NFLfastR is empty, we need alternative data sources OR better 'I don't have that data' boundaries.
