0) Goal (today → playable)

You can:

See live weekly Power Rankings (overall + by position)

Click a player → see expected/floor/ceiling + RAG color

Run A vs B compare that explains the call

Get ranks that update when injuries/QB changes hit

1) Bring the engine up (kills mock data)

On the otc-power box:

# start service
npm i
npm run dev &               # 8084
npm run recalc:nightly
npm run recalc:events &


Smoke tests

curl "http://localhost:8084/api/power/OVERALL?season=2025&week=1" | jq '.items[0:10]'
curl -X POST http://localhost:8084/api/voice \
 -H "content-type: application/json" \
 -d '{"intent":"PLAYER_OUTLOOK","players":["Drake Maye"],"season":2025,"week":1}' | jq


If either call fails or returns empty, we’re still on mock—fix before touching frontend.

2) Flip the site to live endpoints

Kill any “sample/live” toggles.

Point pages to:

GET /api/power/OVERALL|QB|RB|WR|TE?season=2025&week=1

GET /api/power/player/:id?season=2025

POST /api/voice (Start/Sit, Trade, Waiver, Outlook)

POST /api/voice/compare (A vs B)

3) Minimal UI that’s actually useful

A) Rankings page (per position + overall)

Columns: Rank | Player | Team | Power | ΔW | Exp | Floor | Ceil | RAG

Row click → Player drawer

B) Player drawer

Top: Name, team/pos, RAG badge (GREEN/AMBER/RED)

Numbers: Expected / Floor / Ceiling, PowerScore, Market delta (+/- ranks)

Tags: “Rushing QB”, “Beating projections”, “Favorable matchup”

Mini sparkline (last 5 PowerScores)

C) Compare modal

Inputs: Player A, Player B

On submit → call /api/voice/compare

Show verdict, confidence, bullets (script/coverage/weather), and the two cards with exp/floor/ceil

4) Data freshness must be visible

Add “Last updated” timestamp on rankings page (from response)

If data is older than 24h, show a yellow “stale” chip (don’t hide it)

5) Production reliability (bare minimum)

Run otc-power with pm2/systemd (so 8084 doesn’t die)

Cron the data pulls + nightly recompute (already documented)

Simple health pinger: homepage calls /api/power/OVERALL on load; if fail → show maintenance banner, not empty lists

6) Your golden path test (do this yourself)

Open site → OVERALL list shows >250 players, not 30.

Filter to QB → confirm rushing QBs (Maye/JJM) show top-12ish if profiles warrant.

Click a player → see Exp/Floor/Ceil + RAG.

Compare two players you actually care about this week → get a verdict with reasons that make sense.

Trigger a fake event (QB change) → refresh list → affected WR/TE move immediately.

7) Acceptance criteria (Ship if all true)

Pages use live data only; no mock leftovers.

Every item shows Exp/Floor/Ceil & RAG.

/api/voice returns structured, respectful answers (no sass-bot lines anywhere).

Compare returns a verdict with numeric edge (Δ expected points).

Engine survives a restart (pm2) and cron runs without manual nudges.

8) Likely blockers & quick fixes

Service up but empty ranks → run npm run bt:import:sleeper + npm run bt:scrape:ecr for Week 1, then npm run recalc:nightly.

Name mismatches → add alias rows (e.g., Nathaniel → Tank) and re-run scraper.

Missing projections for non-RB → temporarily set proj=league median so RAG still computes (clearly mark as “baseline proj”).

Compare stubs (odds/weather/coverage) → keep weights tiny; still useful with Power+RAG alone.

9) Concrete task list (assignable)

Backend: ensure 8084 up (pm2), run backfill/import/scrape, nightly & events running.

Backend: verify /api/voice and /api/voice/compare return sane payloads.

Frontend: hook rankings table to live endpoints; add RAG/Exp/Floor/Ceil columns.

Frontend: build Player drawer + Compare modal.

Ops: install cron & add simple uptime ping + stale badge.

Strong take: once those five UI pieces are live and the service is stable, you will actually use OTC to set your lineup.
