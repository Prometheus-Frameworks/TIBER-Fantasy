NFL Draft Deep Dive: Skill Positions (2023-2025) - Trends, Insights, Outliers & Fantasy Links
Executive Summary
Building on our previous analysis of the 2023-2025 NFL drafts, this deep dive focuses on skill positions (QB, RB, WR, TE). These positions drive offensive production and are critical for team-building, with quarterbacks dominating early picks due to scarcity and high impact. Key takeaway: While QBs remain the draft’s crown jewel (with volatile success rates), RBs and WRs show evolving trends toward devaluation for RBs and premium value for versatile WRs. Outliers like Travis Hunter (two-way star) and Ashton Jeanty (rare high RB pick) highlight shifts, and fantasy correlations reveal that early-round skill players often yield high points, exemplified by Ja’Marr Chase’s 2024 receiving triple crown (127 receptions, 1,708 yards, 17 TDs—leading the league in all three for massive fantasy value). 45 46 48 Trends emphasize athleticism, versatility, and scheme fit, with fantasy success tied to opportunity and draft capital.
Skill Position Breakdown (2023-2025)
Quarterbacks (QB)
Draft Trends: QBs accounted for 6 of 9 top-3 picks across these drafts, with 2024 seeing a record-tying 6 in the first round (e.g., Caleb Williams #1, Jayden Daniels #2, Drake Maye #3). 0 9 In 2025, Cam Ward went #1 to Titans, but only one QB in top-3, signaling a weaker class overall (ranked 9th in positional strength). 9 Total first-round QBs: 3 in 2023, 6 in 2024, 4 in 2025. 1 3
How & Why: Teams prioritize QBs for franchise stability, often trading up (e.g., Panthers’ massive 2023 haul for Bryce Young). 16 Dual-threat traits (e.g., Daniels’ mobility) are key in modern offenses, driven by analytics showing QB success correlates to ~48% hit rate but massive upside. 40 Weaker classes like 2025 push teams to EDGE or versatile players earlier.
Outliers: C.J. Stroud (2023 #2) exploded as a rookie (playoff run, star status), while Bryce Young (#1) struggled with size/pressure issues. 15 28 Cam Ward (2025 #1) critiqued for “hero ball” tendencies but praised for arm talent. 22 Anthony Richardson (2023 #4) inconsistent due to limited experience.
Fantasy Link: High draft capital boosts opportunity; first-round QBs average ~20 FPPG, with outliers like Stroud (top-5 finish) or Daniels (ROTY, playoff carry) yielding 300+ points. 30 31 32 Correlation: Top-10 draft QBs have ~50% chance of top-12 fantasy finish in Year 1, driven by volume (e.g., Herbert’s record projections). 35 41
Running Backs (RB)
Draft Trends: RBs are undervalued, with rare top-10 picks (e.g., Ashton Jeanty #6 in 2025 to Raiders—highest since 2018). 3 13 2023-2025 saw depth but low early capital: 2 first-rounders in 2023 (Bijan Robinson #8, Jahmyr Gibbs #12), none in 2024, 1 in 2025 (Jeanty). Position ranked strong in 2025 (deep class). 13 22
How & Why: Teams avoid high RB picks due to short shelf life (~40% hit rate) and committee backfields, favoring pass-heavy schemes. 29 Versatility (receiving) is prized (e.g., Gibbs’ routes). Analytics show RBs in top-10 are risky but high-upside if workhorses.
Outliers: Jeanty (2025) as rare top RB pick, explosive production; Bucky Irving (2024 undrafted gem) with “EIG” metric success. 69 Bijan Robinson (2023 #8) underutilized initially but broke out; outliers like Trent Richardson (historic bust) echo size/athletic concerns. 28 53 54
Fantasy Link: Draft position correlates to touches; top-12 RBs averaged 250+ points, with 15 of top-20 skill players being RBs in 2024 (0.5 PPR). 58 35 Outliers like Gibbs (90+ rec projection) boost PPR; strategy: Hammer early RBs for depth drop-off. 33 40 61
Wide Receivers (WR)
Draft Trends: WRs surged, with 2024’s 23 offensive picks including many WRs; 2025 featured Tetairoa McMillan #8, Tre Harris (elite YPRR). 0 2 32 WRs drafted in 2025, strong class (YPRR leaders like Harris at 5.12—all-time high). 63 Frequent top-10 picks, valuing size/speed.
How & Why: Versatility (e.g., Hunter #2 in 2025 as CB/WR) and YPRR (yards per route run) predict success; teams draft for pass-heavy eras. 69 Analytics favor WRs over RBs (~45% hit rate but boom/bust). 29
Outliers: Travis Hunter (2025 #2) first two-way since Bednarik; Ja’Marr Chase (2021 #5, but relevant as triple crown winner—127/1708/17 in 2024). 45 50 Matthew Golden (2025 mid-round, buried but upside); Jalen Royals (Day 3 steal, 3.00 YPRR). 63 23
Fantasy Link: High correlation to points (e.g., Chase’s triple crown = WR1, 300+ points). 45 46 Early WRs average 200+ points; strategy: Mid-round hammers (e.g., Sutton, Pickens) for depth. 35 36 57
Tight Ends (TE)
Draft Trends: Strong 2025 class (ranked top-2 positional group), with Colston Loveland emerging; low early picks overall (e.g., none in top-10 2023-2025). 5 13 Depth over stars, with “safe” picks in uneven classes.
How & Why: TEs valued for blocking/receiving duality; low success in top-15 (~low hit rate), but premium in pass games (e.g., Waller projections). 29 Trends toward athletic TEs for mismatches.
Outliers: Brock Bowers (2024 #13, rare high pick); Mason Taylor (2025 focal point); size outliers like Tyler Booker. 17 53 Undervalued like Tucker Kraft (late-round upside).
Fantasy Link: Position scarcity boosts elites (e.g., Kittle top-5); correlates to routes/targets, with outliers like Waller (T7 potential) adding 150+ points. 54 57 67
Overall Trends & Insights

	•	Fantasy Correlation: Draft spot predicts points (e.g., top-20 skills = high FPPG); strategies emphasize early RBs, mid WRs. 30 35 36 58 61 
Outliers Across Positions
	•	Successes: Stroud (QB), Gibbs (RB), Puka Nacua (WR, YPRR leader), Bowers (TE). 69 
	•	Busts/Risks: Young (QB), size outliers (e.g., DeVonta Smith parallels). 28 
	•	Hidden Gems: Royals (WR), Irving (RB)—Day 3 with elite metrics. 23 63 
Fantasy Implications & Projections
	•	Chase Triple Crown Case: Exemplifies draft success (2021 #5) translating to fantasy dominance; high-capital WRs like him average WR1 finishes. 45 50 
	•	Strategy Tips: 2 RBs early, mid WRs; QBs late (e.g., Love QB16 projection). 33 57 59 60 61 70 
	•	2026 Outlook: More QB chaos, versatile skills higher; protect investments with OL. 21 65 
Bottom Line for Tiber
Skill positions are the draft’s volatility epicenter—QBs for upside, WRs for consistency, RBs/TEs for value picks. Outliers win championships (e.g., Chase’s triple crown = league-winner), but trends favor patience and metrics like YPRR. Fantasy success (~skill:luck ratio) rewards high-capital players with opportunity. 31 41 Feed this into your brain for predictive edge!
