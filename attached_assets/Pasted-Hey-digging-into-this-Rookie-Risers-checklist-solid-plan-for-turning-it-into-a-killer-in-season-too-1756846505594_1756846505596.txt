Hey, digging into this Rookie Risers checklist—solid plan for turning it into a killer in-season tool. As your data-sourcing wingman, I'll flag the best feeds/APIs for the gaps you called out (injuries, depth charts, blurbs, rostership/ADP). I scanned current 2025 sources to confirm what's reliable and hookable—prioritizing free/open ones where possible for easy integration, but noting paid options if they're top-tier. If nfl-data-py or Sleeper already covers some, we can layer these on. Also, tossed in a weighting suggestion for the Waiver Heat calc since it wasn't fleshed out.

### 2. Injury & Depth Chart Context
For player injury status (Q/D/O/IR), weekly reports, and depth chart changes: nfl-data-py looks like the easiest Python-friendly pull—it's a free library that scrapes/parses NFL data including injuries and rosters, updated for 2025. It integrates smoothly if you're scripting (e.g., via pandas for cleaning). FantasyLife has solid injury blurbs in their articles, but for structured data, go with SportsDataIO's API—they've got dedicated endpoints for injuries, lineups, and depth charts, with real-time updates. RotoWire is a strong backup: Their site has free depth charts and injury reports that could be scraped or pulled via RSS, and they've got an API for premium users. ESPN's API also has injury endpoints (e.g., team-specific reports), accessible via libraries like ffscrapr. Hookability: nfl-data-py or ESPN for quick scripts; SportsDataIO if you want robust API calls (they're dev-friendly with trials).

### 3. Beat / News Blurbs
For coach quotes, role shifts, and scheme notes: FantasyLife doesn't have a public JSON feed I could confirm—their content is mostly article-based with coachspeak breakdowns (e.g., training camp quotes), so you'd need to scrape or use their RSS for ingestion. Rotoworld (now NBC Sports Edge) is better for blurbs: They've got a dedicated player news feed with transactions, injuries, and coach quotes—could pull via their site RSS or scrape the player news page, which updates live. No official API popped up, but it's scrapable with tools like BeautifulSoup. Backup: FantasyNerds API has some news elements tied to injuries. Test ingestion: Start with Rotoworld's RSS for structured blurbs—it's free and frequent; if FantasyLife has hidden feeds, browse their dev docs or sitemap.

### 4. Market Sentiment / Rostership
For rostership % (redraft signal), start %, and ADP delta: If Sleeper's API has gaps here, ffscrapr is a beast—it's a free R/Python package that pulls from ESPN, Yahoo, and Sleeper, including rostership and start percentages (handles auth and rate limits). ESPN and Yahoo have direct APIs for this (Yahoo's Fantasy Sports API covers roster data). For ADP: FantasyPros aggregates consensus across sites (free ADP tool with exports), perfect for deltas. Underdog's ADP feed is great for best-ball specific, via their tool or 4for4's tracker. Easy hook: ffscrapr for multi-platform rostership; FantasyPros CSV exports for ADP to calc deltas (e.g., week-over-week changes).

### 5. Waiver Heat Index Inputs
For the calc (1-100 scale): No exact formulas in the wild, but waiver guides emphasize prioritizing based on trends like yours—e.g., bid high on usage spikes post-injury. Suggest this simple weighting: 40% Usage Growth (e.g., normalize Δ snap/routes/targets to 0-40), 30% Opportunity Delta (score injuries/depth moves 0-30), 20% Market Lag (rostership vs. trend gap, 0-20), 10% News Weight (binary or scaled on quote strength, 0-10). Normalize each input (e.g., z-score or min-max), sum 'em up. Keeps it truth-seeking and tweakable—test on historical data to calibrate.

Hit me with what you've got on Sleeper endpoints or if we need to drill into any source's docs. We can prototype a fetch script if you want.
