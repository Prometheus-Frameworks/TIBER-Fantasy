File 1: /AGENT_BOOTSTRAP.md
Purpose: one canonical “start here” instruction that forces reading guardrails every session.

# AGENT_BOOTSTRAP — REQUIRED PRE-FLIGHT

Before performing ANY work in this repository, you MUST:

1) Read and comply with:
- /manus/MANUS_CONTEXT.md
- /manus/MANUS_RULES.md
- /CURRENT_PHASE.md
- /BACKLOG.md

2) Confirm you understand current constraints by writing a **Preflight Acknowledgement** in:
- /reports/manus_preflight_latest.md

Preflight Acknowledgement format:
- Date/time:
- Branch you will work on:
- Tasks you intend to do:
- Files you will not touch:
- Confirmation: "PRs only, no merges to main"

3) If any required file is missing, STOP and open a GitHub Issue:
Title: "Bootstrap missing file: <path>"
Body: What is missing + why you need it.

You are not allowed to proceed until Preflight is complete.


File 2: /CURRENT_PHASE.md
Purpose: the anchor that prevents scope creep.

# CURRENT_PHASE — Stabilization & Governance

Phase Name: Stabilization & Governance
Last Updated: <<VERIFY: date>>

Primary Objectives (do not exceed 5):
1) FORGE correctness hardening (bounds, monotonic tiers, no anomalies)
2) Sentinel/validation improvements
3) Repo cleanliness + documentation clarity
4) CI reliability (typecheck/lint/tests)
5) Performance + batch stability where applicable

Out of Scope (hard no):
- New modules (IDP, rookie scanner, world vectors, etc.)
- New ingestion pipelines
- DB schema changes / migrations
- Changes to FORGE scoring weights or tier thresholds unless explicitly requested by owner
- Any automation that posts/sends messages without owner approval

Definition of Done (must be measurable, fill with real checks):
- Alpha clamped 0–100: <<VERIFY: where enforced / tests>>
- Pillars clamped 0–100: <<VERIFY>>
- Tier mapping monotonic: <<VERIFY: test or script>>
- Batch endpoint stable under load: <<VERIFY: endpoint + benchmark method>>
- Sentinel checks passing: <<VERIFY: where sentinel runs + output>>

Active Workstreams (max 3):
- <<FILL_FROM_REPO: e.g., FORGE regression fixes>>
- <<FILL_FROM_REPO: CI / test harness>>
- <<FILL_FROM_REPO: docs / README>>


File 3: /BACKLOG.md
Purpose: parking lot for expansion ideas, with phase tags.

# BACKLOG (PARKING LOT)

Rule: If it is not in CURRENT_PHASE, it goes here.

## Phase 2 — Expansion Candidates
- IDP Lab (Havoc Index + Defensive DNA)
  - Why: <<FILL>>
  - Requires: <<FILL>>
  - Risks: <<FILL>>
- Offensive DNA (OC coaching shift + EPA/play projection layer)
  - Why: <<FILL>>
  - Requires: <<FILL>>
  - Risks: <<FILL>>
- World Model (Player trait vectors, embeddings-like representations)
  - Why: <<FILL>>
  - Requires: <<FILL>>
  - Risks: <<FILL>>
- Rookie Scanner (2026 rookie data ingestion)
  - Why: <<FILL>>
  - Requires: <<FILL>>
  - Risks: <<FILL>>

## Phase 3 — Automation / Community
- X notification workflow (draft-only; no auto-post)
- Email draft workflow (draft-only; no auto-send)
- Contribution guidelines + issue templates + release cadence


Folder: /manus/ (create if missing)

File 4: /manus/START_HERE.md
Purpose: human-readable onboarding plus the strict “read these first.”

# START HERE (Manus Onboarding)

You must begin every session by opening /AGENT_BOOTSTRAP.md.

Quick links:
- /manus/MANUS_CONTEXT.md
- /manus/MANUS_RULES.md
- /CURRENT_PHASE.md
- /BACKLOG.md
- /TIBER_CONTEXT.md (informational)

If you are asked to do anything that conflicts with CURRENT_PHASE, you must refuse and instead open an Issue explaining the conflict.


File 5: /manus/MANUS_CONTEXT.md
Purpose: operational constraints + verified commands.

# MANUS_CONTEXT — Operational Rules for Tiber Repo Work

Last Updated: <<VERIFY date>>

## Mission
Operate as a constrained engineering agent focused on Stabilization & Governance.

## Hard Constraints
- PRs only; never merge to main
- Never force-push or rewrite history
- No DB schema changes or migrations
- No FORGE scoring weight/tier threshold changes unless explicitly requested
- No dependency upgrades unless explicitly requested
- No “cleanup refactors” unless tied to a specific issue/task
- Max PR scope: <= 8 files changed unless explicitly approved

## Where Things Live (MUST be accurate)
- Frontend pages: <<VERIFY actual path>>
- Shared UI components: <<VERIFY actual path>>
- Backend route registration: <<VERIFY actual path>>
- FORGE module: <<VERIFY actual path(s)>>
- Data Lab module: <<VERIFY actual path(s)>>
- Sentinel module: <<VERIFY actual path(s)>>
- Drizzle schema: <<VERIFY actual path(s)>>

If any path cannot be verified, write UNKNOWN and open a GitHub Issue.

## How to Run (MUST be accurate)
- Install deps: <<VERIFY command>>
- Start dev server: <<VERIFY command>>
- Run typecheck: <<VERIFY command>>
- Run lint: <<VERIFY command>>
- Run tests: <<VERIFY command>>
- Build: <<VERIFY command>>

## Required Session Output
Every session must produce:
- /reports/manus_daily_YYYY-MM-DD.md
and update:
- /reports/manus_preflight_latest.md (preflight acknowledgement)


File 6: /manus/MANUS_RULES.md
Purpose: the “do not cross” boundaries.

# MANUS_RULES — Non-Negotiables

## Never do these:
- Push directly to main
- Merge PRs
- Modify secrets, .env files, or credential stores
- Perform DB migrations
- Modify production deployment config
- Change FORGE scoring weights / tier thresholds
- Add new external dependencies
- Expand scope beyond CURRENT_PHASE

## Always do these:
- Work in a feature branch named: manus/<short-task-slug>
- Open a PR for every change
- Use the PR template in /manus/PR_TEMPLATE.md
- Include tests or explain why not
- Provide a validation note for any output-affecting change
- Stop and open an Issue if uncertain


File 7: /manus/PR_TEMPLATE.md
Purpose: consistent PR quality.

## Summary

## Why

## Scope
Files touched:

## Behavior Change

If Yes: provide before/after evidence.

## Testing
- Commands run: <<VERIFY actual test commands>>
- New/updated tests: <<LIST>>

## Risk Notes
Potential side effects.

## Rollback Plan
