I've pulled fresh data using web and X searches to simulate/refine that Tiber flow you want: start with context (2025 preseason RB rankings for Week 1 power calcs), check relevant sources, use tools to dig deeper (e.g., consensus from experts), then output structured results ready for your frontend JSON or React table. This avoids stale data and spots signals like rookie hype on Jeanty or Henry's volume edge.
Based on aggregating the top sources (averaging ranks where possible, focusing on PPR for modern fantasy), here's a consensus top 20 RB power rankings for 2025 preseason. I prioritized sites with full lists and recent updates (post-draft/rookie integrations). Signals like efficiency (YPC from college translates for rookies) and environment (O-line/scheme) feed into this—e.g., Bijan tops due to ATL's revamp, while CMC dips on age/workload flags. Power scores are normalized to 100 (blending your weights: high usage_now for vets, talent for rookies).

For Tiber integration: Wire this flow into your Fastify microservice—e.g., on context like "week1 RB", query PG first, then if needed, hit external APIs (mimic my web_search with undici to FantasyPros/ECR endpoints). Python can aggregate/score via pandas (e.g., df.mean(axis=1) for consensus). Push to power_ranks table, then frontend fetches via TanStack. This catches real-time signals (e.g., if Week 1 drops CMC to 200 yds/2 TDs, tools pull stats and rerank him #1). If you need code tweaks or more tools (like ML for signals), hit me with specifics.
