I want a full computation spec / audit for WR Role Bank v1.1 so I can review it with another model (Grok).

Please generate a single markdown file at:
/tmp/WR_ROLE_BANK_V1_1_AUDIT.md
that clearly documents the following:

Data Inputs (Source Tables & Fields)

List every table and column used in the WR Role Bank v1.1 calculation, including:

weekly_stats fields

player_usage fields

bronze_nflfastr_plays fields (for deep targets)

any joins to player_identity_map or player_positions

For each input, explain in 1 short sentence what it represents (e.g. “air_yards = depth of target in yards”).

Feature Engineering Steps

Show the exact formulas for:

targetsPerGame

targetSharePct

routesPerGame (if used)

deepTargets20Plus

deepTargetsPerGame

deepTargetRate

any z-scores used (volumeZ, highValueZ, etc.)

If any filtering is applied (e.g. “only weeks where deepTargets20Plus is not null”), write that out explicitly.

Scoring Algorithm (WR Role Bank v1.1)

Show the exact code/formulas you use to compute:

volumeScore

consistencyScore

highValueUsageScore

momentumScore

final roleScore (with the 55/15/20/10 weights)

Include any normalization steps (z-score, min/max scaling, etc.).

Tier Logic

Document exactly how CO_ALPHA, SECONDARY, ROTATIONAL, etc. are assigned in v1.1.

If this uses z-score thresholds, list the thresholds.

Sample Rows (For Debugging)

For the following WRs, include a small table with ALL intermediate fields and the final roleScore + tier:

CeeDee Lamb

Amon-Ra St. Brown

Ja’Marr Chase

Puka Nacua

Emeka Egbuka

Tetairoa McMillan

Wan’Dale Robinson

This should show: targetsPerGame, targetShare, deepTargetRate, volumeScore, highValueUsageScore, final roleScore, and tier.

Export Instructions

When you’re done, just confirm:

the file path (/tmp/WR_ROLE_BANK_V1_1_AUDIT.md)

and the size/line count so I know it generated correctly.

Do not change any logic in this step.
This is purely an explainability / audit report so another model (Grok) can review the implementation and outputs.
