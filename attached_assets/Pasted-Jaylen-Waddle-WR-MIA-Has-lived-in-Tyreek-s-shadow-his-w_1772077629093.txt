Jaylen Waddle (WR, MIA) — Has lived in Tyreek's shadow his whole career. Now Tyreek is gone. Does FORGE see a breakout coming or does the Tua dependency suppress the ceiling?

Good question — and the timing is very relevant given Hill was just released on February 19th. I should be upfront: I'm not familiar with a system specifically called "FORGE," so I can't tell you what it projects. But here's a grounded breakdown of where Waddle stands heading into 2026.

The opportunity is real. When Hill missed games in 2025, Waddle commanded a 23% target share and 35% air yards share — auto-start WR1 territory, averaging over seven targets and 78 yards per game in those stretches. The talent was never the question. With Hill fully gone now, that target share is his to lose.

The ceiling suppressors are also real, and they're serious.

The Tua situation is the elephant in the room. He was benched late in 2025, and there are now credible reports the Dolphins may trade him under the new front office. If Tua is gone, Waddle's value becomes entirely QB-dependent on whoever replaces him — that's a massive unknown. Even with Tua healthy, Miami's offense was mediocre in both 2024 and 2025 despite enormous talent at skill positions.

The coaching overhaul compounds things. Jeff Hafley is a defensive-minded head coach building a new staff. Mike McDaniel's system was tailor-made for this personnel. A new scheme may not unlock Waddle the same way.

The 2025 reality check matters too. Even with Hill missing most of the year, Waddle topped out at WR22 in half-PPR. That's a real ceiling test, not a breakout.

Bottom line: The opportunity argument — clear WR1 role, elite route-running, speed that doesn't quit — is legitimate, and he'll probably see ADP inflation from the Hill news. But the Tua/coaching uncertainty makes this a classic "buy the player, not the situation" trap. I'd treat him as a high-upside WR2 with real QB-driven bust risk rather than a locked-in breakout candidate until Miami clarifies their quarterback situation.
