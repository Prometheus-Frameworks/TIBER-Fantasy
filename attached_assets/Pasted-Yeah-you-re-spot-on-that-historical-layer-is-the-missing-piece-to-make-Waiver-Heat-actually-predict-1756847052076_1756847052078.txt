Yeah, you're spot on—that historical layer is the missing piece to make Waiver Heat actually predictive instead of just a snapshot. Without deltas (like snap % from Week 1 vs. Week 2), it's all current-state noise. Tiber's audit already flags the need for week-to-week tracking, so let's plug this gap with sources that handle trends directly. I dug into APIs/databases that store historical data for snaps, ADP, and depth charts (focusing on 2025-relevant ones, since we're in early Sept). Here's what stands out, prioritized for easy integration—free/open where possible, with hooks into your existing infra like nfl-data-py or Sleeper syncs. I'll flag how they feed the formula components too.

### Historical Snap Counts (for Usage Growth Deltas)
These pull week-by-week snaps, so you can calc deltas (e.g., Week 2 snap % - Week 1) on the fly or store 'em.

- **nfl-data-py**: Already in Tiber's recs—it's a free Python lib that grabs snap counts as dataframes, with historical records back years. Pull weekly, store in your persistence layer (e.g., DB table for rookies), and diff for growth. Ties right into Usage Growth: Normalize deltas (e.g., +15% snaps = high score).

- **FantasyData API**: Game-by-game snap breakdowns over seasons, including percentages. Their endpoint lets you query by week/player—perfect for trends. Free tier for basics; if you need more, it's affordable. Calc deltas server-side when building /api/rookies/usage-weekly.

- **SportsDataIO NFL API**: Covers snaps with historical data (back to 2000-ish), real-time updates. Query by week for deltas. Dev-friendly cloud API; trial available. Bonus: Integrates injuries too, feeding Opportunity Delta.

Other solid backups: FTN Fantasy (free stats tool with logs) or FantasyLife (season-long snaps). If scraping's an option, Lineups has live 2025 snaps.

### Historical ADP Trends (for Market Lag)
Need time-series ADP to spot movement (e.g., rookie's ADP dropping 20 spots WoW means undervalued lag).

- **Fantasy Football Calculator API**: Free REST API for ADP data, with historical pulls by date range. Track changes over time—e.g., query last week's ADP vs. current for deltas. Direct fit for Market Lag: If usage spikes but ADP hasn't caught up, bump the score.

- **4for4 Underdog ADP Tool**: Visualizes changes over time, but scrapable or via their data feeds. Focuses on best-ball ADP trends; great for rookies like Jeanty rising pre-season.

- **ffanalytics API**: Endpoint for ADP data, including averaged historical. Simple GET requests; build deltas in your /api/market-sentiment.

Backups: FantasyPros aggregates consensus ADP with exports for trends; Yahoo's tool has "Last 7 Days" deltas. SportsDataIO again for fantasy-specific historical.

### Historical Depth Charts (for Opportunity Delta)
Week-by-week archives to detect changes (e.g., rookie jumps from RB3 to RB2 after vet injury).

- **Sportradar API**: Weekly Depth Charts feed with history—query by week for diffs. Quantify Opportunity Delta: Score +20 if rookie moves up a tier.

- **Ourlads.com**: Archives depth charts by week/team; scrapable for historical. Free access, updated for 2025—store snapshots in DB for change detection.

- **SportsDataIO**: Depth charts with historical player feeds; includes lineup changes. Easy to diff week-to-week.

Backups: RotoWire (updated charts, some history); ESPN's offensive charts (scrapable for trends). nfl-data-py for rosters that imply depth.

### Tying It to Persistence Layer
To make this stick without constant re-pulls: Build a simple DB (e.g., PostgreSQL or even SQLite in your setup) to store weekly snapshots from these APIs. Cron job the syncs (e.g., post-Sunday games), then query for deltas in the Waiver Heat formula. For the calc, stick with the weighting I suggested earlier, but add a time-decay if trends are multi-week (e.g., bigger delta over 2 weeks = higher score). If we prototype in code (your REPL?), I can help test a fetch/store script.

This closes the gap without overcomplicating—start with nfl-data-py and SportsDataIO for broad coverage. What does Tiber think now, or want to prioritize for a PoC?
