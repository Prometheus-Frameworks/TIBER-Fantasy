TASK: Identity Bridge Enrichment v1 (Roster-first) + Ownership Fallback + Audit update

Goal: Increase identity.roster_bridge_coverage by auto-populating missing player_identity_map.sleeper_id for players appearing on synced league rosters, and ensure ownership never misclassifies unmapped players.

A) Add a roster-first enrichment endpoint
	1.	Create endpoint: POST /api/league/enrich-roster-identity
	•	Uses active league from user_league_preferences
	•	Reads all league_teams.players Sleeper IDs
	•	Finds which are missing in player_identity_map (no row with that sleeper_id)
	•	For each missing Sleeper ID:
	•	Fetch Sleeper player metadata from Sleeper players endpoint (cached locally in DB or in-memory for 24h)
	•	Attempt to match to a canonical player record using deterministic rules:
	•	First: match by gsis_id / player_id if present in Sleeper payload and matches our canonical GSIS format
	•	Else: match by full_name + position + team
	•	If multiple matches → mark ambiguous and skip
	•	If matched: update player_identity_map.sleeper_id
	•	If not matched: store in a new table unmapped_sleeper_players with fields:
	•	sleeper_id (pk), full_name, position, team, status_reason, raw_json, first_seen_at, last_seen_at
	•	Return summary:
	•	attempted, matched, ambiguous, unmapped, updatedRows
	•	plus new_roster_bridge_coverage

B) Ownership service fallback + truth status
	2.	Update ownership service so unresolved players return unknown_unmapped instead of defaulting to free agent / other.
	•	Response should include:
	•	status: owned_by_me | owned_by_other | free_agent | disabled | unknown_unmapped
	•	hint for unknown_unmapped: “This player is in Sleeper rosters but not mapped to canonical_id yet.”
	•	Preserve existing behavior for mapped players.

C) Feature audit improvements
	3.	Update /api/system/feature-audit:
	•	Keep identity.roster_bridge_coverage thresholds, but:
	•	If status is critical due to <70%, include:
	•	actionHint: "Run /api/league/enrich-roster-identity to improve mapping"
	•	unmappedSample should show sleeper_id + name/team/pos if available from unmapped_sleeper_players

D) Sanity checks required (must paste outputs)
	4.	Provide these checks in the update:
	•	Before/after:
	•	roster_bridge_coverage (mapped/total)
	•	count(*) unmapped_sleeper_players
	•	Curl:
	•	POST /api/league/enrich-roster-identity
	•	GET /api/system/feature-audit
	•	GET /api/league/ownership?playerId=<some known unmapped sleeper player’s canonical OR the sleeper id case> (ensure unknown_unmapped returns safely)

Constraints:
	•	Must be idempotent (running twice shouldn’t duplicate unmapped entries or spam updates)
	•	Caching: Sleeper players payload should not be fetched repeatedly per player (use bulk fetch once + cache)
	•	Never throw: endpoints return structured errors
