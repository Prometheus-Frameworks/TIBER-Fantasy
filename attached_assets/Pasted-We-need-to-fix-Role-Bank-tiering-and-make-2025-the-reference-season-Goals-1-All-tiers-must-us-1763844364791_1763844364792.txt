We need to fix Role Bank tiering and make 2025 the reference season.

Goals:
1) All tiers must use roleScore instead of volumeScore.
2) Seasons with tiny samples (e.g. 4 games) should not define tiers.
3) 2025 roleScore distribution should anchor our thresholds going forward.

### Step 1 – WR tiering fix

In the WR Role Bank service (computeWRRoleBankSeasonRow):

- Introduce a constant: const MIN_GAMES_FOR_TIER = 8;
- Change the tier classification to use roleScore instead of volumeScore.
- If gamesPlayed < MIN_GAMES_FOR_TIER, set roleTier = 'UNKNOWN'.
- Otherwise, use these default thresholds for now:

  ALPHA       ≥ 88
  CO_ALPHA    ≥ 80
  PRIMARY     ≥ 70
  SECONDARY   ≥ 60
  ROTATIONAL  ≥ 48
  LIMITED     < 48

Make sure volumeScore is no longer used for tier decisions.

### Step 2 – RB tiering guard + thresholds

In computeRBRoleBankSeasonRow:

- Add const MIN_GAMES_FOR_TIER = 8;
- If gamesPlayed < MIN_GAMES_FOR_TIER, roleTier = 'UNKNOWN'.
- Otherwise, use these thresholds:

  ELITE_WORKHORSE  ≥ 88
  HIGH_END_RB1     ≥ 80
  MID_RB1          ≥ 70
  STRONG_RB2       ≥ 60
  ROTATIONAL_RB    ≥ 48
  LIMITED_USAGE    < 48

Confirm that classification is based on roleScore, not volumeScore.

### Step 3 – TE tiering guard + thresholds

In computeTERoleBankSeasonRow:

- Add const MIN_GAMES_FOR_TIER = 8;
- If gamesPlayed < MIN_GAMES_FOR_TIER, roleTier = 'UNKNOWN'.
- Otherwise, use:

  ELITE_TE1   ≥ 88
  STRONG_TE1  ≥ 78
  MID_TE1     ≥ 66
  HIGH_TE2    ≥ 54
  STREAMER    ≥ 44
  BLOCKING_TE < 44

Again, classification must be based on roleScore.

### Step 4 – 2025-based calibration (optional but preferred)

Implement a small utility or script that:

- For each position (WR, RB, TE), fetches all 2025 Role Bank rows with gamesPlayed >= 8.
- Computes the roleScore distribution and reports percentile cutoffs for:
  - Top ~6–8 players
  - Next ~6–8
  - Next ~10–12
- Returns a summary so we can adjust the hardcoded thresholds above if needed.

You do NOT need to make tier thresholds fully dynamic yet; just compute and log suggested values so the architect can review.

### Step 5 – Re-run 2025 batches and report

Re-run the Role Bank batch computation for 2025 only (WR/RB/TE) and return:

- Tier counts per position for 2025.
- Updated RoleScore + tier for:
  - RB: Christian McCaffrey, Bijan Robinson, Jahmyr Gibbs, Kyren Williams
  - TE: Sam LaPorta, Trey McBride, Travis Kelce, Dalton Kincaid
  - WR: Amon-Ra St. Brown, CeeDee Lamb, Ja'Marr Chase, Malik Nabers

We expect:
- 2025 CMC to be ELITE_WORKHORSE.
- McBride/LaPorta to live in ELITE_TE1 or STRONG_TE1.
- Top WRs to show up as ALPHA/CO_ALPHA.
