Got a ship to prod doc for you, there's a few tasks at the bottom : 🚀 OTC v2 Launch Checklist

✅ Data Foundation
	•	Full coverage: W1–W17, 16,932 rows
	•	Positions included: QB, RB, WR, TE
	•	SOS context integrated into player_inputs
	•	No missing core fields (snap_pct, team, position)

✅ Core Systems
	•	DeepSeek methodology active (redraft + dynasty scoring)
	•	VOR fixed (RB40, WR48, TE16, QB12 replacement levels)
	•	Tier clustering stable (≥3 players/tier, no singletons)
	•	Weight override validation (bad payloads return 400)
	•	Debug reconciliation (calc_check matches score)

✅ API Layer
	•	/api/ratings → player rankings with weights + debug
	•	/api/ratings/tiers → tier cutoffs and groups
	•	/api/players/:id/rating → single player + trends
	•	Error codes correct (400/404 handling verified)
	•	Performance: sub-300ms for large queries

✅ QA Assertions
	•	Coverage Assert — W1–W17 (17/17 weeks)
	•	VOR Assert — accurate within 0.1 points
	•	Weight Override Assert — proper 400s for bad payloads
	•	Debug Math Assert — scores reconcile within 1.0

✅ Stability
	•	Server restart recovery tested
	•	Data persistence confirmed (16,932 rows intact)
	•	Batch recompute endpoint operational

🎯 Launch Phase Tasks
	1.	Run full QA suite one last time → confirm all 4 assertions pass with W1–W17.
	2.	Deploy Ratings + Tiers explorer to front-end as v2’s banner feature.
	3.	Publish changelog (internal: “v2 = full season, fixed VOR, debug transparency”).
	4.	Lock v2 branch → treat as production baseline.
