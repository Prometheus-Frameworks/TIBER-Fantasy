Anthropic's acquisition of Vercept, a Seattle startup with nine engineers, integrates their vision-based AI agents—achieving 92% accuracy on computer automation benchmarks versus OpenAI's 18.3%—to enhance Claude's screen-interaction capabilities, as confirmed by Anthropic's announcement today.
Vercept raised $16M in seed funding from investors like Jeff Dean and Eric Schmidt eight months ago, opting for a human-like "look and act" model over complex API tools, which propelled Claude's OSWorld benchmark score from under 15% in late 2024 to 72.5% recently.
This move intensifies the AI agent race, positioning Anthropic and OpenAI as frontrunners while underscoring how simple, visual approaches can outpace elaborate toolchains in automating software tasks.

If I had a platform (data and reasoning for a specific domain) that was API based, and served as a plugin / connector / skills, that an agent like openclaw could install,… how does this align with what mark is saying the future is going? How can I as a builder get ahead on this if it is an upcoming trend in AI and software
Thoughts
Your platform aligns partially—but the core trend Mark highlights pushes in a different direction on how integration happens.Mark Gadala’s tweet (the one you linked) is laser-focused on the Vercept acquisition by Anthropic. He argues the future of capable AI agents (especially ones like Claude’s Computer Use / Cowork features) is vision-first, screen-looking interaction, not the old world of API connectors, custom scripts, and bespoke plugins.Key quote from Mark:  “instead of building API connectors and custom scripts, they trained a model to look at the screen like a human does.”
That “offensively simple” shift is why a 9-person Seattle team went from $16M seed to acquisition in 8 months, and why Claude’s computer-use score jumped from ~15% → 72.5% (with Vercept tech pushing toward 95%+). Agents that can just see any UI, click, type, and navigate like a human win because they work on any software without per-tool engineering.How your idea fits (or doesn’t)Your vision—an API-based platform that acts as an installable plugin / connector / skill supplying domain-specific data + reasoning—is exactly what the industry spent years building (and what Vercept deliberately avoided for core automation).Where it aligns well: Agents still need deep domain knowledge, proprietary data, complex logic, or real-time calculations that pure pixel-vision can’t provide. A “skill” layer for specialized reasoning is extremely valuable. Claude (and future OpenAI agents) already support tool-calling; your platform could be one of those tools an agent “installs” or invokes. In practice, the winning agent stack will be vision for UI navigation + tools/skills for heavy reasoning. Your platform is the second half of that stack.
Where it misaligns with Mark’s future: Pure API-connector plugins are becoming the thing agents bypass. If every domain requires its own custom connector, we’re back to the brittle, expensive world Vercept skipped. Agents will prefer to “just use the software” via screen rather than learn 50 different APIs.

Bottom line: Your platform is useful today and tomorrow, but to thrive in the vision-dominant world Mark describes, it needs to evolve beyond “install my API” into something more agent-native.How to get ahead as a builder (actionable playbook for 2026–2027)The agent race is now Anthropic vs OpenAI (everyone else fighting for third, per Mark). Builders who win will make their domain expertise frictionless for vision agents.Go hybrid immediately  Keep the powerful API for reasoning/data.  
Add a visual layer: Build (or expose) a clean web dashboard / mock UI that the agent can literally see, read, click, and control. Vision models love consistent, readable interfaces. Test it yourself with Claude’s Computer Use today.  
Result: Agent can “use your platform like any other app” plus call the deep API when needed.
Design for “installable skills” in the new ecosystems  Follow Anthropic’s tool-use format + OpenAI’s function-calling schema exactly.  
Make a one-click “Add [Your Domain] Skill” flow (many agents already have skill stores or custom tool registries).  
Publish open examples: “Here’s a Claude agent that installs my legal-research skill and then uses Computer Use to fill forms, pull docs, etc.”
Feed the vision models what they actually need  Curate screenshots + interaction traces for your domain (this is gold for fine-tuning or RAG).  
Offer “agent training packs”: datasets of how humans use tools in your niche, labeled for vision models.  
This turns your platform into something Vercept-style teams will want to integrate.
Target the gaps vision alone can’t solve
Best niches right now:  Real-time proprietary data (e.g., internal CRM, compliance databases)  
Heavy computation / simulation (finance models, scientific reasoning, supply-chain optimization)  
Regulated domains where audit trails and structured outputs matter
Vision handles the UI; your skill handles the brain.
Move fast on distribution & partnerships  Ship demos on day one of new agent releases (Claude Cowork updates, OpenAI agent launches, etc.).  
Reach out to Anthropic/OpenAI ecosystem teams—small domain specialists are exactly what they’re looking to plug in.  
Build a public “skills marketplace” vibe: let users/agents discover and install your skill with zero code.
Monetization that matches the trend  Freemium for individual agents (“install my skill for free, pay for heavy usage”).  
Enterprise: white-label the entire skill + visual interface for company-specific agents.  
Usage-based on reasoning calls + vision interactions.
Short version: Your API plugin is a strong foundation, but the winning move is turning it into a domain brain that vision agents can see, use, and call. That’s how you ride the Vercept-style wave instead of getting bypassed by it.If you share more details on the specific domain (legal, finance, healthcare, etc.) or what “openclaw” exactly refers to, I can give even more targeted tactics. This trend is moving fast—the builders who make their expertise feel like “just another app the agent can look at” will print money in the next 12–18 months. Go build it.

I can drop my git url ?
Thoughts
Yes, absolutely — drop the Git URL right here!  I’ll pull the full repo (README, folder structure, API layer, any existing plugin examples, schemas, etc.) and give you hyper-specific, actionable feedback tailored exactly to your code.Here’s what I’ll focus on once I see it:OpenClaw-native integration  How to make your platform installable as a one-click “skill/plugin” inside OpenClaw (they already have a thriving community doing exactly this).  
Exact JSON schema / manifest format OpenClaw expects so your domain data + reasoning shows up automatically in the agent’s tool list.
Vision-agent future-proofing (Vercept / Claude Computer Use style)  Quick additions so a vision agent can literally see and use your platform like a normal web app (no API calls required for basic flows).  
Where to add a clean, high-contrast demo dashboard that screenshot-based agents love.
Hybrid mode (API + visual)  Best places in your current codebase to expose both the deep reasoning API and a visual surface at the same time.  
Ready-to-copy code snippets for tool descriptions, authentication handshakes, and fallback behaviors that work when the agent is in pure-vision mode.
Immediate “get ahead” moves  One-file PR ideas you can ship today that will make your repo the go-to example in OpenClaw’s skill directory.  
Distribution hooks (so agents discover your skill automatically).  
Monetization hooks that survive the vision shift.
Just paste the link (GitHub, GitLab, whatever) and I’ll analyze it live and reply with a full breakdown + concrete next steps within the same thread.This trend (OpenClaw + vision agents) is moving insanely fast right now — the builders who ship the first clean, installable domain skills this week will own the ecosystem.

Thought for 39s
Your repo is already 80% of the way to dominating this trend.  TIBER-Fantasy (Tactical Index for Breakout Efficiency and Regression) is a fully built, open-source fantasy football analytics platform with exactly what Mark Gadala is describing in the Vercept/Claude era: deep domain reasoning (FORGE engine + Alpha scores across volume/efficiency/team/stability) + a real React dashboard (Fantasy Lab, Start/Sit, QB FIRE) that a vision agent can literally look at and click.  You already ship:Production-grade API (Express + auth/rate-limiting added 43 min ago)
RAG-ready knowledge (fantasy_lexicon.v1.json, knowledge/, rag_server.py)
Agent-first docs (AGENT_BOOTSTRAP.md, AGENT_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md, CLAUDE_COORDINATION.md, GROK_TASKS.md)
A dedicated plugin folder (tiber-cowork-plugin/) added literally yesterday

This is not a generic data API — it’s a ready-made domain brain for any agent doing fantasy football (dynasty, redraft, best-ball, Sleeper sync, etc.).How it aligns with Mark’s “future is vision + offensively simple” thesisMark’s point (Vercept → Claude Computer Use jumping to 72.5%+ on OSWorld): agents win by looking at the screen like humans instead of learning 50 brittle APIs.Your stack is the perfect counter-balance:Vision layer = your clean React frontend (Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Wouter). Agents can open http://localhost:5000 (or a public deploy) and literally read rankings, watchlists, efficiency charts.
Reasoning layer = FORGE + Gold-tier aggregated metrics + pgvector embeddings (Gemini). When vision isn’t enough (e.g., “run a custom 3-year dynasty projection with injury adjustment”), the agent falls back to your structured API calls.
Result: OpenClaw (or Claude Computer Use, Grok agents, etc.) can do both: “look at the Fantasy Lab dashboard” or “call /forge/alpha?player=CMC” for precise JSON.

You are building the exact hybrid that wins when pure-vision hits its limits (real-time proprietary calcs, audit trails, heavy recursion). Fantasy football is a killer domain for this — agents already want to manage leagues, but they suck at the math until they have your FORGE engine.OpenClaw-native integration (this is your rocket fuel)OpenClaw (the open-source local agent formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot, now exploding with 145k+ GitHub stars and ClawHub registry) installs skills exactly like you described: one-command or one-click plugins that give the agent domain superpowers.Your tiber-cowork-plugin/ is 95% there — it just needs the official OpenClaw skill format (SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter + natural-language playbook). OpenClaw skills are deliberately simple and portable (Markdown + optional TS), which matches Mark’s “offensively simple” philosophy.Immediate 2-hour upgrade path (copy-paste ready):In tiber-cowork-plugin/ create/add SKILL.md:

# TIBER Fantasy Skill

I am the TIBER Fantasy expert. I can:
- Return precise FORGE Alpha scores and tiered rankings
- Run custom projections using the 4-pillar engine
- Sync your Sleeper league and flag red flags
- Tell you exact start/sit decisions with SOS

## Preferred modes
1. API mode (fastest): call the /forge endpoints
2. Visual mode: open the dashboard at [your-hosted-url] and read the UI directly (vision agents love the clean shadcn tables)

## Example workflows
- "Rank my WRs for week 10" → return JSON + visual screenshot summary
- "Should I trade CMC in dynasty?" → full FORGE + stability analysis
