These are conservative, production-safe seeds (derived from typical yearlong relationships). They’ll immediately anchor scores to expected fantasy points (xFP) and prevent depth WRs from clustering at the top.

How Tiber should wire the seeds

Load seeds if no trained coeffs exist

Add to xfpRepo.loadAll():

If DB table xfp_coeffs is empty, load /config/xfp.coeffs.seed.json.

Expose model_info in the response (r2, sample, pos, source: "seed"| "trained").

Expose model info in v3 API (optional)

In /api/rankings/deepseek/v3 response, include:

{
  "mode": "dynasty",
  "count": 1200,
  "model_info": {
    "WR": {"r2": 0.58, "sample": 5000, "source": "seed"},
    "RB": {"r2": 0.61, "sample": 4800, "source": "seed"},
    "TE": {"r2": 0.47, "sample": 3200, "source": "seed"},
    "QB": {"r2": 0.65, "sample": 4500, "source": "seed"}
  },
  "data": [ ... ]
}


Swap to trained coeffs automatically

After POST /api/admin/xfp/train?weeks=1-17 writes DB rows, xfpRepo.loadAll() should prefer DB over seeds.

One-line repo ticket addendum (paste under v3.1 task)

Add seed xFP coefficients: Load /config/xfp.coeffs.seed.json when xfp_coeffs table is empty. Include model_info in /api/rankings/deepseek/v3. After training, auto-switch to DB coeffs. This ensures elite players surface immediately and depth vets don’t crowd the top pre-training.

Quick acceptance checks (5 minutes)

Top 20 Dynasty WR shows Chase/Jefferson/ARSB/Puka/Lamb/Waddle/Olave (not depth vets).

No player with routeRate < 8% or snaps/game < 8 in Top 100.

Scores vary (no identical blocks), tiers look sensible.

Optional: Debug toggle shows model_info.source = "seed" until training runs.
