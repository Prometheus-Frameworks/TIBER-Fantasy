Here's my honest take after spending significant   
  time in the guts of this system:                                          
                                                                            
  What's genuinely strong                                                   
                                     
  The 4-pillar architecture is sound. Volume, efficiency, team context,     
  stability — that decomposition maps cleanly to how fantasy value actually 
  works. Most ranking systems are opaque blends; FORGE's pillar structure   
  makes it debuggable and tunable, which is rare.

  The recursive alpha engine is clever. The prior-blending (80/20) with
  momentum is a smart way to add temporal smoothness without overreacting to
   single weeks. It's conceptually similar to what good Bayesian systems do.

  The football lens is a good idea. Having a separate layer that detects
  football-sense issues (TD spikes, volume/efficiency mismatches) and
  applies bounded corrections is architecturally clean. It's the right place
   to encode domain knowledge that doesn't fit into the pillar math.

  Where I'd be concerned

  The pipeline is fragile to data quality. We just saw this — a single
  zero-dropback week could crater an elite QB's stability. The snapshot data
   has inconsistencies (snap_share meaning different things in week 17 vs
  other weeks, null values in week 18). Every derived metric in FORGE is one
   bad data week away from producing garbage. I'd invest heavily in data
  validation layers before the data enters the pillar computations.

  The identity resolution is a liability. The batch endpoint passes GSIS IDs
   to functions that do WHERE canonical_id = ${playerId} lookups. This works
   by accident — the fallback to using the raw ID happens to match the
  snapshot table. But it's a latent bug. A single function that
  canonicalizes IDs at the boundary would prevent a whole class of issues.

  Calibration is doing too much heavy lifting. The raw pillar scores cluster
   in a narrow range (e.g., RB raw 23-64), and the linear calibration
  stretches that to 25-95. That's a 1.56-2.0x amplification factor. Small
  pillar changes get magnified into large alpha differences. The real fix is
   getting the pillar scores to naturally span a wider range, rather than
  relying on calibration to spread them out.

  The role bank data looks quantized. Volume scores of 22, 31, 35, 40, 44,
  55, 69, 83, 93, 100 — those aren't continuous distributions, they're
  discrete buckets. If the upstream role bank is binning players into tiers
  before FORGE sees them, you're losing granularity that matters. FORGE
  can't distinguish between the 15th and 25th ranked QB if they both land in
   the volume_score=44 bucket.

  What I'd prioritize next

  1. Data quality guardrails upstream — validate snapshot data before it
  reaches FORGE. Flag weeks with null snap_share, anomalous values
  (snap_share=1), or zero primary metrics.
  2. End-to-end integration tests with real data — the guardrail tests I
  wrote are a start, but you need tests that actually hit the database and
  verify specific players. "Josh Allen is top-5 QB" should be a test that
  runs on every deploy.
  3. Continuous role bank scores — if the role bank is producing quantized
  scores, consider using the raw underlying metrics (carries_per_game,
  targets_per_game) directly rather than pre-bucketed scores. The xFP volume
   pillar already does this correctly by going to the snapshot data.
  4. FPOE efficiency pillar — right now volume (xFP) and efficiency use
  different baselines. If efficiency becomes Fantasy Points Over Expected
  (actual minus xFP), the two pillars become perfectly complementary with
  zero double-counting. That's a clean decomposition worth pursuing.

  The overall direction is good. The main risk isn't the math — it's the
  data pipeline reliability and the tight coupling to upstream data formats
  that can silently change.
