4️⃣ Implement Δ Severity Bands + Styling

We want the disagreement filter to be more than a checkbox — we want tiers of disagreement.

Ask the agent:

Add severity bands based on delta = forgeAlpha - sandboxAlpha:

function getDeltaSeverity(delta: number) {
  const abs = Math.abs(delta);
  if (abs >= 15) return 'major';
  if (abs >= 8) return 'moderate';
  if (abs >= 4) return 'minor';
  return 'none';
}


Use getDeltaSeverity on both WR and RB rankings.

In the table UI:

minor → subtle tint

moderate → stronger tint

major → strong highlight (this is “review me now”)

“Show big disagreements only” toggle:

Filter to moderate + major (abs(Δ) ≥ 8).

This gives us a stable visual language for disagreements before we even touch RB calibration.

5️⃣ Handle Missing FORGE Scores Gracefully

We already saw cases like Odunze / MHJ / McConkey with FORGE α = -.

Tell the agent:

On the rankings pages (WR and RB), if a player has:

Sandbox row but no FORGE score, show:

FORGE α → —

Δ → —

Make sure the “show big disagreements” filter doesn’t hide these; they should stay visible as “no engine score yet”, not vanish.

Optional: add a small pill or tooltip:

Missing FORGE data or No 2025 engine score

This keeps the UX honest and prevents confusion when rookies / partial season guys pop in.

6️⃣ Add a Simple Calibration Debug Endpoint / Log

We’ll need p10/p90 for RB/TE/QB soon. Have the agent set up the plumbing now.

Ask it to:

Create a small internal function that computes percentiles for rawAlpha per position from 2025 data:

async function getRawAlphaDistribution(position: Position, season: number) {
  const scores = await forgeRepo.getRawAlphaValues(position, season);
  // compute p10, p50, p90, min, max
  return { min, p10, p50, p90, max };
}


Option A (simpler): log to server console when /api/forge/batch is called with a debug flag:

If query has debug=true, print:

[FORGE DEBUG] WR 2025 rawAlpha: min=X p10=Y p50=Z p90=A max=B


Option B (if you want an endpoint):

// GET /api/forge/debug/distribution?position=WR&season=2025


We don’t need a UI for this. Just want future-you to be able to quickly pull fresh p10/p90 and plug them into ALPHA_CALIBRATION for other positions.

7️⃣ Wire /rankings/rb Into Nav + Routing

Agent should not just create the component and forget it.

Ask it to:

Add RB Rankings to:

The router (e.g. /rankings/rb)

The sidebar / nav menu next to WR Rankings.

Reuse the same layout shell as WR Rankings:

Same header style

Same filters at the top if present (season/week toggles, etc.)

The goal: WR and RB rankings feel like a matched pair, not some hidden dev-only page.

8️⃣ Add rawAlpha to Dev View (Hidden Behind a Toggle)

We don’t want users seeing rawAlpha, but we do want you and Tiber to have an easy way to inspect it.

Ask the agent:

Add a small dev-only toggle at the top of WR/RB rankings, something like Show rawAlpha (dev).

When enabled:

Show an extra column: rawAlpha

Or show it in a tooltip when hovering over FORGE α.

Implementation idea:

const [showRawAlpha, setShowRawAlpha] = useState(false);


Then conditionally render the column/cell.
