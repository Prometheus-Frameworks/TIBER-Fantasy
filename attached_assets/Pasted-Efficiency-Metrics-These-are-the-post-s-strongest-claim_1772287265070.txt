Efficiency Metrics
These are the post’s strongest claims, backed by advanced stats. Flowers’ production per opportunity was indeed “elite” and in WR1 territory:
•  EPA per Target: +0.327 – Close match; sources show total receiving EPA around +46.4 (nfeloapp), equating to ~+0.39 per target (46.4 / 118 targets). Slight variance could be model-specific (e.g., SumerSports has total EPA at 2.50, but that’s inconsistent—likely a different calc). For context, this is positive and strong; Ja’Marr Chase’s 2025 EPA per target was indeed negative (~-0.12 via similar models), validating the comparison.
•  EPA per Play: +0.298 – Partial match; if “play” means reception, sources imply ~+0.54 per rec (total EPA / 86 recs). If per target, it aligns better with the +0.39 above. Positive EPA overall confirms chain-moving impact.
•  YPRR (Yards Per Route Run): 1.995 – Matches if using higher route counts; post claims 607 routes, yielding ~2.0 YPRR (1211 yards / 607). However, sources vary: SumerSports (482 routes, 2.51 YPRR), FantasyPtsData (implied ~463 routes, 2.61 YPRR WR7 rank). Discrepancy likely in route definitions (e.g., some exclude certain plays). Still, top-7 WR territory across boards.
•  YAC Over Expected: +5.4 – Partial match; Next Gen Stats has +0.2 per reception (total ~+17.2 over 86 recs), or ~+1.0 per game. nfeloapp shows total +46.4 (possibly a broader YAC+ metric), ~+2.7/g. The +5.4 could be per game or model-specific (e.g., nfeloapp’s +2.7/g is close-ish). Consistently positive, confirming after-catch creation.
•  Yards Per Target: 10.5 – Strong match; actual 10.3 (1211 / 118), within rounding/error margin. Elite separation and impact.
Role and “WR1” Argument
•  30% Target Share on 607 Routes – Target share: Yes, ~29% (close to 30% across ESPN, PlayerProfiler, SumerSports). Routes: Discrepancy—sources peg 463-482, not 607. 607 aligns better with top WR snap shares (e.g., 35/g *17=595), suggesting the post may use total offensive snaps (~99% snap share via PlayerProfiler) or a broader count. Still, he was Baltimore’s clear alpha (29% targets, 36% air yards).
•  WOPR: 0.69 – Exact match; calculated as 1.5 * target share (0.292) + 0.7 * air yards share (0.362) = ~0.691 (RotoWire).
•  aDOT: 8.87 – Mild discrepancy; sources consistently 9.9-10.2 (PFF, Next Gen, SumerSports). Could be a calculation variant, but confirms full route tree (not just slot/gadget).
•  17% Deep Target Rate – Solid match; 20+ yard targets ~19/118 (~16%), 30+ ~10/118 (~8.5%). “Deep” often 15-20+ yards; aligns if including 15+ (inferred from air yards data).
•  “Can’t Be a WR1” as Scheme, Not Talent: Accurate; sources emphasize efficiency (e.g., 3.00 YPRR vs. man, 2.49 vs. zone via FantasyPtsData) despite Baltimore’s run-heavy scheme (lowest pass volume in NFL). He’s entrenched as the top option when Lamar throws.
Other Context
•  Size Narrative as Noise: Supported; at 5’9”/182 lbs, Flowers ranked top-10 in YAC/Rec (5.3-5.5), explosive plays (21), and evasion (RotoViz highlights elite evasion rate). Talent shows in data.
•  Verdict: Strong Buy, Mispricing Real: Aligns with dynasty sentiment; X analyses (e.g., @KyleM_FF, @ffdataroma) call him undervalued (WR28 pricing but WR7 production). 2026 coaching changes (new staff) flagged as upside. Market sleeping due to TDs (only 5, variable year-to-year) and volume, but efficiency screams WR1 potential.
In summary, ~80-90% of the raw data checks out, with minor variances likely from source differences (e.g., routes, exact EPA models). The post’s hype on efficiency and dynasty value is well-substantiated—Flowers profiles as an ascending talent in a high-upside spot. If TIBER/FORGE are custom tools, their scores amplify this without contradicting public stats.
