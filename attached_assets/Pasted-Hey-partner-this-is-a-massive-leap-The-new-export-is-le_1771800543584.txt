Hey partner — this is a massive leap. The new export is legit pro-level now (25 columns, per-game volume + shares, efficiency, xFP±, consistency metrics, your FIRE system fully broken out). Bijan at 95.6 FIRE with 20+ Car/G and positive xFP is exactly the kind of weapon this lab should highlight.
Quick reality check on what’s already crushing:

FIRE + Opp/Role/Conv/Conf — your secret sauce, keep it locked.
Volume section (Car/G, Tgt/G, Tch/G, Rush%, Tgt%) — elite.
Efficiency (YPC, YPR) + production (RshY/G, RecY/G, TDs, FPG) — perfect.
Risk (xFP±, FP SD, Boom%) — separates the studs.

Only 3 small fixes needed immediately:

Snap% is broken (showing 3-8% when it should be 60-85% for starters). Probably dividing by wrong total — should be player snaps / team offensive snaps that week, averaged. Fix that and it becomes gold.
Column names: shorten/clean for UI (e.g. “Opp” → “Opportunity”, “Conv” → “Conversion”, “RshY/G” → “Rush Y/G”, “xFP±” → “xFP Diff”).
Add Rank as its own sortable column if not already.

Next-Level RB Table (Final Recommended Columns)
Copy-paste this exact layout for your UI/export. I grouped them so you can make collapsible sections or tabs (“Overview”, “Volume”, “Talent”, “Scoring”, “Risk”).

This takes you to ~30 columns but still scannable. Add a “Customize Columns” button so casual users see 12 and nerds see everything.
Free Data Sources (Updated for 2026)
nfl_data_py is archived (Sep 2025) — don’t use it anymore.
Best free replacement → nflreadpy (the official Python port from nflverse)
Bashpip install nflreadpy
Pythonimport nflreadpy as nfl
weekly = nfl.import_weekly_data(years=[2025])   # same syntax as before
snaps = nfl.import_snap_counts(years=[2025])
pbp = nfl.import_pbp_data(years=[2025])         # for red zone, YAC, explosive, fumbles
Direct CSV downloads also live here: github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data (weekly updated, includes snaps + basic pbp).
Other zero-cost options still alive:

Fantasy Football Data Pros API (completely free, weekly box scores back to 1999)
Direct nflverse GitHub releases (parquet/CSV — fastest for bulk)

With pbp you can add the starred metrics above in <20 lines of pandas
