TIBER REPLIT AGENT — PULSE DRIVERS ROW v1 (FRONTEND ONLY, MINIMAL)

Goal:
Under the existing 3W Pulse row in PlayerPage Usage section, add a compact “Drivers” line explaining what most contributed to the pulse score.

Constraints:
- Frontend only (no endpoint changes)
- Must be consistent with the exact pulse computation already implemented (same windows, same weights, same selected-week fallback)
- Minimal diff

Definition:
You already compute component deltas per metric (avgA - avgB) and apply weights.
For each included metric, compute contribution:
  contribution = weight * delta

Drivers selection:
- Sort metrics by ABS(contribution) desc
- Take top 2 (or top 3 if the third is >= 50% of the second)
- Each driver displayed as:
  "<MetricName> ↑" if delta > 0
  "<MetricName> ↓" if delta < 0
  "<MetricName> →" if delta == 0
- Also include the numeric delta in tooltip only (keep row clean)

UI:
- Row text (small, terminal style):
  "Drivers: Targets ↑, Routes ↓"
- Color the arrows (green/red/gray) but keep metric names neutral
- If pulse is “— Not enough weeks” or “— Insufficient data”:
  show "Drivers: —" and match tooltip reason.

Tooltip (on hover of Drivers row):
- List each shown driver with delta and contribution, e.g.
  Targets: Δ +2.3 (w=1.0, contrib=+2.3)
  Routes: Δ -1.5 (w=0.6, contrib=-0.9)
- If fallback week used, include the same "(WkX missing, using WkY)" note.

Implementation steps:
1) Reuse existing pulse calculation outputs (do not recompute windows twice).
   - If you currently compute pulse inline, refactor slightly into a helper that returns:
     { pulseScore, classification, metricsUsed: [{key, delta, weight, contribution}] , windowAWeeks, windowBWeeks, fallbackNote }
2) Build drivers list from metricsUsed.
3) Render Drivers row beneath Pulse row.

Deliverables:
- Snippet showing drivers computation
- Screenshot-style description of how it renders
- Confirm it matches pulse score contributors exactly (no divergence)
