Here's the handoff for the agent:

Task: Extend Distribution Debug Endpoint for All Positions
Context
The /api/forge/debug/distribution endpoint currently only returns distribution data for WR. We need it to accept a position parameter and return the same analysis for QB, RB, and TE.
This is blocking our ability to set proper calibration parameters for QB and TE, which currently have no calibration defined (causing their alpha scores to appear much lower than WR/RB).
Current Behavior
GET /api/forge/debug/distribution
→ Returns WR distribution only, ignores position param
Required Behavior
GET /api/forge/debug/distribution?position=QB
GET /api/forge/debug/distribution?position=TE
GET /api/forge/debug/distribution?position=RB
GET /api/forge/debug/distribution?position=WR
Each should return the same structure:
json{
  "success": true,
  "position": "QB",
  "season": 2025,
  "week": 10,
  "distribution": {
    "count": <number>,
    "min": <number>,
    "p10": <number>,
    "p25": <number>,
    "p50": <number>,
    "p75": <number>,
    "p90": <number>,
    "max": <number>
  },
  "calibrationSuggestion": {
    "p10": <number>,
    "p90": <number>,
    "outMin": 25,
    "outMax": 90
  }
}
```

### Implementation Notes

1. The endpoint likely lives near the other FORGE debug/admin routes — check `apiRegistry.ts` or wherever `/api/forge/debug/distribution` is defined.

2. The distribution calculation logic already exists for WR. The fix should be:
   - Accept `position` as a query param (default to WR for backwards compatibility)
   - Filter the player pool by the requested position
   - Run the same percentile calculations

3. Make sure the query pulls from the correct data source — should be calculating distribution on raw/uncalibrated alpha values (before the calibration step), otherwise the output won't be useful for setting calibration params.

4. Validate that position param is one of: `QB`, `RB`, `WR`, `TE`. Return 400 if invalid.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Endpoint accepts `?position=QB|RB|WR|TE` param
- [ ] Returns accurate distribution stats for each position
- [ ] Distribution is calculated on pre-calibration alpha values
- [ ] Invalid position returns 400 error
- [ ] Default behavior (no param) returns WR for backwards compatibility

### After Implementation

Run these and send back the output:
```
GET /api/forge/debug/distribution?position=QB
GET /api/forge/debug/distribution?position=TE
We need the p10/p90 values to set calibration for QB and TE.
