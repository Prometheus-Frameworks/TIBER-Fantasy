Task: Implement RB calibration in FORGE v0.2

Use the existing ALPHA_CALIBRATION + calibrateAlpha pattern we use for WR.

Right now, RB forgeAlpha = rawAlpha, in a tight band (~36–53), with huge negative deltas vs Sandbox.

Goal: spread RB calibrated scores onto an intuitive 0–100-ish scale, similar to WR:

Elite RBs (CMC, JT, Bijan, Gibbs, Achane) → roughly 75–95

Strong RB1/2s (Cook, Jacobs, Barkley, Etienne, Breece) → 60–80

Solid but flawed / committee backs → 45–65

Steps to implement:

Use the RB rawAlpha distribution to get real p10/p90:

Either via the debug helper we discussed
(e.g. /api/forge/debug/distribution?position=RB&season=2025)
or by computing in the forge service:

min, p10, p50, p90, max across all 2025 RB rawAlpha values.

Set ALPHA_CALIBRATION.RB accordingly in the shared config, e.g.:

ALPHA_CALIBRATION.RB = {
  p10: <RB_p10>,
  p90: <RB_p90>,
  outMin: 30,   // lower visual bound
  outMax: 90,   // upper visual bound
};


Tune outMin/outMax so the top RBs land in that 80–95 zone similar to elite WRs.

Make sure calibrateAlpha(raw, 'RB') is actually called in the forge pipeline:

Anywhere we currently set:

score.rawAlpha = raw;
score.alpha = raw;


change to:

score.rawAlpha = raw;
score.alpha = calibrateAlpha(raw, 'RB');


After implementing, sanity check:

Pull GET /api/forge/batch?position=RB&season=2025&week=10

Confirm:

rawAlpha remains in the 36–53 band

alpha is now spread ~30–90+

Δ for CMC/JT/Bijan/Gibbs/Achane is no longer -50+ but more like -15 to +10.

2️⃣ Call out the export / week toggle mismatch

Your exports for week 6 and week 10 are literally the same file. Agent claims:

“CMC at week 4: 45.9, at week 10: 46.6”

But your JSON shows 45.4 for both 6 and 10. So something’s lying — either:

The UI display is correct and the export feature is stale, or

The agent tested via some other path (Postman/curl) that’s not wired to your export button.

You can be blunt here:

Task: Fix RB Export Week Binding

I exported RB Rankings JSON for week 6 and week 10 and they are identical (same forgeAlpha, same deltas).

You said CMC changes from 45.9 (week 4) to 46.6 (week 10), but my export shows 45.4 for both 6 and 10.

Please:

Verify that the export function on /rankings/rb:

Uses the same season and week state as the table.

Either:

Exports the already-fetched in-memory rows currently displayed, or

Calls the same API with the active season/week.

Ensure that when I change the week toggle:

The table refetches using the new week.

The export reflects that exact data (no default params, no stale cache).

Add a small debug log or label (temporary is fine):

e.g. “Exporting RB rankings for season=2025, week=6” so we can visually confirm.

3️⃣ How we’ll know RB is actually “fixed”

What I’ll expect to see after the agent’s next pass:

Forge RB calibrated like WR:

forgeRawAlpha in the tight 36–53 band

forgeAlpha fanned out (e.g. CMC closer to 80–90, mid guys in 55–75)

Δ no longer giant systemic -40/-50s — more like (-15 to +10) with a few strong disagreements.

Week toggle + export:

Exporting week 4 vs week 10 gives different JSON.

The top names stay the same, but values subtly shift with week.

Once that’s in, then we can actually start reading RB disagreements the way we did WR:

Is FORGE lower than you on Kyren because of explosiveness / insulation?

Is it too low on Breece because of TD luck / offensive environment?

Is it pumped on weird guys like Dowdle / Harvey?

Right now, all it’s saying is “I live in the 40s,” which we already beat out of WR.
