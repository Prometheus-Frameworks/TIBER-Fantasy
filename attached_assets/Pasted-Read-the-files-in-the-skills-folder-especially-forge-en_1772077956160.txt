Got everything I need. Config loaded, following the procedure — let me hit the three API endpoints in sequence.

The TIBER API endpoint is being blocked at the network proxy level (403 Forbidden — blocked-by-allowlist). All three calls — player search, FORGE, FIRE, and CATALYST — are failing for the same reason. The sandbox environment Cowork runs in doesn't have outbound access to the Replit-hosted API.

Per the hard rule in player-eval.md:

"No live TIBER data available for Jaylen Waddle. I can discuss the framework but cannot provide Alpha scores without a live API response."

What this likely means practically: The TIBER API is hosted on Replit, and the Cowork sandbox proxies outbound traffic through an allowlist that doesn't include that domain. This is a network access restriction on the Cowork side, not an issue with the API itself. A few things that could fix this:

Run the eval from Claude Code directly on your local machine, where outbound network isn't sandboxed — the plugin config and command files are all set up correctly.
Use a tunnel or proxy to expose the TIBER backend through a domain that's allowlisted (e.g., mapping it through a custom domain).
Check if Cowork has a network capability setting — in Team/Enterprise plans, Owners can adjust outbound network access in Admin → Capabilities.
The plugin config, forge-engine, tiber-philosophy, and player-eval command all read cleanly and the procedure is sound. It's purely a sandbox connectivity issue. Want me to try hitting the API through a different method, or would you rather run this one from a terminal directly?
