TIBER.AI — System Integrity v1.1: Split Identity Coverage Checks

Goal:
The current /api/system/feature-audit “identity mapping coverage” is technically correct but misleading: it measures global player_identity_map.sleeper_id population (495/1238 ~40%), which is not a blocker for League Ownership. Replace the single check with TWO separate checks: (1) roster-relevant bridge coverage (PRIMARY) and (2) global sleeper_id population (SECONDARY, non-blocking).

Requirements:

1) Update /api/system/feature-audit:
- Replace the existing identity check with:
  A) identity.roster_bridge_coverage (PRIMARY)
  B) identity.global_sleeper_id_population (SECONDARY)

2) identity.roster_bridge_coverage logic:
- Determine active league context (use existing user_league_preferences / active league/team logic already used by ownership service).
- Pull roster Sleeper IDs from league_teams.players for the active league (all teams).
- Denominator = count of unique Sleeper IDs found on rosters.
- Numerator = count that map to canonical_id via player_identity_map.sleeper_id.
- Include details:
  - mapped, total, coveragePct
  - unmappedSample: up to 10 Sleeper IDs that failed mapping
  - note: “Roster coverage is what ownership + player UX depends on.”

- Status thresholds:
  - healthy >= 0.85
  - warning >= 0.70
  - critical < 0.70
- This check SHOULD affect overallStatus (critical should make overall critical).

3) identity.global_sleeper_id_population logic:
- Denominator = active canonical players in player_identity_map (same as current: 1238).
- Numerator = players with non-null sleeper_id.
- Status thresholds (non-blocking):
  - healthy >= 0.70
  - warning >= 0.40
  - info < 0.40
- IMPORTANT: This check must NEVER return “critical”.
- It should NOT force overallStatus to critical by itself.

4) Admin UI card (/admin/forge):
- Update labels to show both checks.
- Ensure the top-level status pill reflects roster_bridge_coverage primarily.
- Keep the UI compact; do not add new pages.

5) Docs:
- Update docs/dev/FEATURE_LINK_MAP.md to reflect the split: global identity coverage is enrichment, roster bridge coverage is correctness dependency.

6) Sanity checks (must run):
- curl /api/system/feature-audit with no params (default)
- curl /api/system/feature-audit?playerId=00-0036900&season=2025&week=3
- Confirm audit returns structured JSON, never throws.
- Ensure existing checks still return.

Deliverable:
- PR-style summary: what changed, where, and the resulting audit statuses (expected: roster coverage ~66% => warning/critical depending thresholds; global ~40% => warning/info).
