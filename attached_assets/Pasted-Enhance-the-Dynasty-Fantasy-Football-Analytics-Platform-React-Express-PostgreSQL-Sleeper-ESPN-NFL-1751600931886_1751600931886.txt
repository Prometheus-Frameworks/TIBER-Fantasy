Enhance the Dynasty Fantasy Football Analytics Platform (React/Express, PostgreSQL, Sleeper/ESPN/NFL-Data-Py APIs) by implementing the following improvements, preparing for the $200 FantasyPointsData subscription and prioritizing user value, scalability, and market inefficiency detection:
1.  Optimize FantasyPointsData Integration: Build automated ETL pipelines for premium metrics (e.g., target share, air yards share). Implement Redis caching to reduce API calls and improve query speed for real-time Trending section updates. Ensure seamless replacement of X placeholders (e.g., X% route participation, X.X dominator rating).
2.  Enhance Trending Section: Add a “Breakout Sustainability Score” (0–100) using FantasyPointsData metrics (e.g., dominator rating, route participation) post-subscription. Create interactive Chart.js charts for snap share trends (Weeks 9–18, 2024). Add user-customizable filters by position/team/metric threshold.
3.  Improve Market Inefficiency Detection: Develop an algorithm to flag players with premium metric-ADP discrepancies (e.g., high target share, low KeepTradeCut value). Build a “Value Arbitrage Dashboard” showing top undervalued/overvalued players, updated daily post-subscription, with confidence intervals based on sample size.
4.  Expand User Interaction: Implement WebSocket/Firebase push notifications for real-time role change alerts. Add a user preference system for alert thresholds (e.g., snap share >20%). Create a “Watchlist” feature to track players’ premium metrics.
5.  Strengthen 2025 Projections: Integrate FantasyPointsData’s red zone share/air yards for refined projections. Build a scikit-learn model to predict 2025 fantasy points using historical metrics, team depth charts, and coaching trends (scraped from ESPN/NFL.com). Add scenario analysis (e.g., “Player X at 25% target share = 15 PPG”).
6.  Enhance Scalability: Stress-test for 1,000+ concurrent users. Optimize database queries (index player_id) and deploy on AWS ECS/Heroku. Implement rate-limiting for FantasyPointsData API to stay within quotas.
7.  Improve Frontend UX: Optimize for mobile with responsive Tailwind CSS design. Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation for accessibility. Introduce dark mode and tooltips explaining metrics (e.g., “Dominator Rating: Team offensive share”).
8.  Add Historical Trend Analysis: Create a “Historical Trends” module for league-wide trade/waiver patterns using FantasyPointsData’s historical metrics. Enable benchmarking (e.g., “Your trade gained 2000 value; league average = 1500”).
9.  Incorporate User Feedback: Add an in-app survey for feature prioritization. Use Google Analytics to track feature usage (e.g., Trending section clicks) and guide enhancements.
10.  Ensure Monetization Compliance: Review FantasyPointsData’s terms for premium data usage. Document API agreements and draft a terms-of-use page outlining data sources/privacy policies.
Prioritize ETL pipelines and Trending section enhancements first, followed by market inefficiency detection and frontend UX. Generate a task list with timelines, ensuring dynamic 2025 ADP/value updates via KeepTradeCut. Prepare backend (API endpoints, schema) and frontend (placeholder system) for seamless FantasyPointsData integration.
