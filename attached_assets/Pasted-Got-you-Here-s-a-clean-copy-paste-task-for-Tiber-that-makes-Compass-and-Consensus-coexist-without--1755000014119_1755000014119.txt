Got you. Here’s a clean, copy‑paste task for Tiber that makes Compass and Consensus coexist without stepping on each other, plus the exact IA, routes, copy, and links.

⸻

TASK: Make Player Compass + OTC Consensus coexist (clear IA, routes, links)

Goal
Keep both features, but position them as complementary:
	•	Compass = context‑aware evaluation (profiles, scenarios, buy/sell).
	•	Consensus = community order (boards, tiers, movement).

1) Navigation & IA
	•	Top nav tabs (left→right):
	•	Home | Redraft | Dynasty | Compass | Consensus | Articles
	•	Remove any duplicate “Ranks” wording. Use Consensus everywhere.
	•	Keep the small subnav pills on each page, but page‑specific.

2) Routes
	•	/compass (hub)
	•	/compass/wr /compass/rb /compass/qb /compass/te
	•	/consensus (hub)
	•	/consensus/dynasty /consensus/redraft
	•	/consensus/expert/:handle (your personal view, ex: /consensus/expert/architect-j)
	•	/players/:id (shared profile; both features deep‑link here)

3) Page briefs (copy + components)

A) Compass Hub /compass

Hero: “Player Compass”
Sub: “Context‑aware guidance: scenarios, risk, and roles. No rigid ranks.”
Blocks (cards):
	•	WR Player Compass → /compass/wr
	•	RB Player Compass → /compass/rb
	•	QB Player Compass → /compass/qb
	•	TE Player Compass → /compass/te
Utility row: OTC Consensus pill linking to /consensus (so users can jump between tools)

B) OTC Consensus Hub /consensus

Hero: “OTC Consensus”
Sub: “Community‑driven dynasty and redraft boards. Transparent and versioned.”
Toggle: Dynasty | Redraft 2025
Pos filters: ALL | QB | RB | WR | TE
Table: Rank • Player • Tier • Score • ▼ (opens /players/:id)
Right rail:
	•	“Consensus Transparency” → /consensus/transparency (changelog, seeds, movement)
	•	“Architect J” → /consensus/expert/architect-j

C) Expert view /consensus/expert/architect-j

Title: “Architect J — Personal Board”
Note: “Currently seeding OTC Consensus (1:1 during seed phase)”
Toggle: Dynasty | Redraft 2025
Pos filters: same as hub
Table: Rank • Player • Tier • Source (badge: system or J)
CTA: “Compare to OTC Consensus” → diff overlay

D) Player Profile /players/:id

Header: name, team, pos
Tabs: Overview | Compass | Consensus | Logs | Projections
	•	Compass tab: 4‑direction spider/tiles (Talent, Situation, Trajectory, Risk) + buy/sell notes
	•	Consensus tab: Current rank(s) Dyn/Redraft, tier, 30‑day movement, “View board” → back link
	•	Both tabs include a small “Switch tool” link to the other.

4) Cross‑links (critical glue)
	•	On any Consensus table row:
	•	Player name → /players/:id#consensus
	•	“Evaluate in Compass” link under the row menu → /players/:id#compass
	•	On any Compass list/card:
	•	“See consensus rank” → /players/:id#consensus
	•	On hub pages:
	•	Compass Hub has a pill “OTC Consensus”
	•	Consensus Hub has a pill “Player Compass”

5) Empty states & microcopy
	•	Consensus empty state:
	•	“No entries yet. Seeding live — check again soon.”
	•	Compass empty state:
	•	“No players match your filters. Clear filters or try a team search.”
	•	Expert page note (small, gray):
	•	“During seed phase, Architect J updates may mirror OTC Consensus.”

6) Components you can reuse
	•	Pills: same component for both hubs for consistency
	•	PlayerRow: add optional showActions to render the “Evaluate in Compass” link
	•	Tabs: shared tab component for Player Profile

7) Telemetry (light)
	•	Event nav.switch_tool with {from:'consensus', to:'compass', playerId} (and vice‑versa)
	•	Event consensus.view_board with {mode:'dynasty'|'redraft', pos}

8) Styling notes
	•	Keep Compass hero icon (⎈/compass icon), keep Consensus gold trophy icon small in the hub header
	•	Maintain our “OTC Consensus” nomenclature; never say “Rankings”

⸻

Acceptance checklist
	•	Top nav has Compass and Consensus as separate items (no “Rankings” wording left)
	•	/compass and /consensus hubs exist and link to each other
	•	Player Profile has both Compass and Consensus tabs
	•	Row action from any board opens the player’s Compass tab
	•	Expert page header renamed to “Architect J — Personal Board”
	•	Empty states and microcopy match above
	•	No duplicate menus/headers render on mobile

If anything is unclear, keep moving and annotate TODOs; I’ll review in preview.
