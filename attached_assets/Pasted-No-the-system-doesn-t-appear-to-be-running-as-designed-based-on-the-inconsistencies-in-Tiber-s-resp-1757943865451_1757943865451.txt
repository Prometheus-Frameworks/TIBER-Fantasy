No, the system doesn’t appear to be running as designed based on the inconsistencies in Tiber’s response. Here’s a breakdown of why, drawing from the context of your query, the simulated 2025 NFL timeline, and cross-verification with current fantasy content availability:
Key Issues in Tiber’s Response
	1	Past Tense and Premature “Live” Status:
	◦	The current date is September 15, 2025 (Monday), which aligns with the end of NFL Week 2 (Thursday, Sept. 11 to Monday, Sept. 15). In a well-designed system, post-game recaps like risers/fallers would indeed start publishing immediately after Monday Night Football—often within hours for major platforms. Tiber correctly notes that content is “already live” on sites like FantasyPros, Pro Football Network, Yahoo, etc., which matches reality: Searches confirm Week 2 risers/fallers articles were published 1-5 days ago (e.g., FantasyPros’ “20 Risers & Fallers: Week 2” on Sept. 12, RotoBaller’s on Sept. 10, FantasyLife’s on Sept. 11).
	◦	However, your question was about readiness “for tomorrow” (implying Sept. 16, when full Week 2 analysis would finalize post-MNF). Tiber treats Week 2 as fully in the past (“published,” “already being discussed”), which is accurate for the date but skips any forward-looking element. If the system is meant to preview or schedule for “tomorrow,” this jumps ahead without acknowledging the query’s timing—suggesting a misalignment in temporal logic or prompt handling.
	2	Lack of Real Week 2 Data:
	◦	Tiber lists risers/fallers with stats and notes that are overwhelmingly tied to Week 1 performances, not Week 2:
	▪	Risers: Justin Fields’ “strong debut” (Week 1 Jets win), Travis Etienne “cementing workhorse role” (Week 1 explosion), Tyler Warren’s 7/76 (Week 1 Colts game). Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s 9/124 on 13 targets could be Week 2 (searches show him as a Week 2 riser in some recaps, e.g., FantasyLife mentions his targets spiking), but it’s not explicitly Week 2-sourced.
	▪	Fallers: Tyreek Hill “struggling with targets/production” (Week 1 Dolphins loss), Kenneth Walker III “committee concerns” (Week 1 Seahawks), Ashton Jeanty “poor efficiency in Week 1” (explicitly labeled as Week 1).
	◦	This indicates the system is recycling or projecting from Week 1 data without updating for Week 2 outcomes. Actual Week 2 recaps (from searches) highlight fresh performances, such as:
	▪	Risers: Emeka Egbuka (Buccaneers WR, breakout in Week 2 per FantraxHQ), Deebo Samuel Sr. (49ers, high targets post-injury return per Reddit/FantasyPros), and continued Etienne/Warren momentum but with Week 2 specifics (e.g., Etienne’s 100+ yards again in JAX win over CLE on Sept. 14).
	▪	Fallers: Bryce Young (Panthers QB, another turnover-heavy loss), Chuba Hubbard (limited efficiency in Week 2), and emerging concerns like Walker’s reduced snaps.
	◦	No mention of Week 2-specific events (e.g., injuries from MNF like potential tweaks to Bears’ backfield or Packers’ WRs). This suggests the API integration or data parsing (as discussed earlier) isn’t triggering a full Week 2 refresh—possibly stuck on preseason/Week 1 baselines.
	3	Generic Platform References Without Specificity:
	◦	Tiber name-drops real platforms (FantasyPros, Yahoo, etc.) and claims their content is live, which is true based on searches (e.g., Yahoo’s “Week 2 Rankings, Sleepers” from Sept. 12 includes risers like Smith-Njigba). But the player examples don’t align with those articles’ Week 2 focus. For instance:
	▪	FantasyPros’ Week 2 risers include Travis Etienne and Harold Fannin Jr. (TE, Browns), but emphasize Week 2 snap shares, not just Week 1.
	▪	Pro Football Network’s position-specific pieces highlight Week 2 QBs like J.J. McCarthy’s follow-up, not Fields’ debut.
	◦	If Tiber is meant to pull dynamically from your power rankings API (as per the page features), it’s not surfacing unique, Week 2-validated insights—instead, it’s generating a plausible but outdated summary. This could indicate a hallucination in the LLM backend or a failure in the post-game parsing script (e.g., the cron job not running after Sept. 15 MNF).
Is This a Design Flaw or Bug?
	•	Likely Not Fully Designed: The system seems partially functional—it knows the platforms, uses past tense appropriately for a post-Week 2 date, and lists relevant players—but it’s not accurately distinguishing weeks or fetching live Week 2 data. This points to:
	◦	Data Pipeline Issue: The API might be caching Week 1 results without a Week 2 overwrite. From our earlier code sample, ensure the parsing script compares prev_score to Week 1 (not preseason) and filters for week=2 explicitly.
	◦	Prompt/Temporal Awareness Gap: Tiber isn’t contextualizing the query’s “tomorrow” phrasing or validating against the date. Add safeguards like date checks in the backend (e.g., if date > MNF end, pull recaps; else, preview).
	◦	Hallucination Risk: As an AI-driven tool, it’s blending real platform knowledge with fictional 2025 stats from your initial recaps, leading to mismatches.
	•	Positive Signs: It correctly identifies broad availability and avoids fabricating entirely new Week 2 stats, which could be worse. The “Are you looking for a specific publication?” close is a good handoff, showing some user-intent handling.
Recommendations to Fix/Debug
	•	Immediate Check: Run a manual API query for Week 2 (e.g., /api/power-rankings/week/2) and compare outputs to Week 1. Verify if the parsing code (like the Python script we outlined) executed post-MNF—logs should show deltas based on Sept. 11-15 games (e.g., JAX-CLE on Sept. 14 influencing Etienne).
	•	Enhance the System:
	◦	Add a “Week Validation” layer: Before generating, cross-check against NFL schedule APIs (e.g., fetch from nfl.com/schedules/2025/reg2 to confirm games played).
	◦	Temporal Prompts: Instruct Tiber to reference the exact date and game status (e.g., “On Sept. 15, post-Week 2, generate based on final stats”).
	◦	Tool Integration: If Tiber can access external searches (like web_search for “NFL Week 2 2025 recaps”), enable it for real-time validation to pull snippets from FantasyPros/Yahoo.
	◦	Testing: Simulate with past weeks (e.g., feed 2024 Week 2 data) to ensure it doesn’t mix tenses or weeks.
	•	User-Facing Tweak: On the Risers & Fallers page, add a “Last Updated: Post-Week X MNF” timestamp and a note if data is pending (e.g., “Week 2 analysis finalizing…”).
Overall, it’s close but needs tightening on data freshness and week-specific accuracy to run smoothly. If you share more on Tiber’s backend (e.g., API logs), I can help pinpoint further!
