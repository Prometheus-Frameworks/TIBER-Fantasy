🔹 Task for Tiber Agent – Nuke EPA Sanity (Keep Data, Delete Branding)

Task: Remove EPA Sanity UI + “Ben Baldwin” References (Preserve Data)

I want to completely remove the EPA Sanity feature from the app, but DO NOT delete any underlying EPA data, tables, or processors. This is a UI/branding cleanup, not a data purge.

Goals:
	•	Remove the EPA Sanity page/tab from the sidebar and any navigation.
	•	Remove any routes/endpoints that are ONLY used by the EPA Sanity page.
	•	Scrub all mentions of “Ben Baldwin” from the codebase (UI labels, comments, docs, etc.).
	•	Keep all EPA-related data tables and calculation services intact (EPA models, team EPA, player EPA, etc.).

1. Frontend Cleanup
	1.	Find and remove:
	•	The sidebar/tab entry for “EPA Sanity”
	•	Any React component specifically dedicated to the EPA Sanity page (e.g. EpaSanityTab, EpaSanityPage, etc.).
	2.	Make sure that after removal, the sidebar renders cleanly with no broken imports.

2. Backend Routes Cleanup
	1.	In routes.ts (or wherever API routes live), find any endpoints that are clearly only used by the EPA Sanity page. Example patterns might include:
	•	/api/epa-sanity/*
	•	/api/epa/validation
	•	anything explicitly referencing “sanity” or “Ben Baldwin”
	2.	Remove those EPA Sanity–specific endpoints only if they are not used anywhere else in the app.
	3.	Do not remove:
	•	Core EPA calculation services
	•	Team EPA endpoints
	•	Any general-purpose EPA endpoints that Rankings or future Analytics might depend on.

3. Scrub “Ben Baldwin” References
	1.	Search the codebase (TS/TSX/MD/MDX/README/etc.) for:
	•	"Ben Baldwin"
	•	"Baldwin"
	2.	For each occurrence:
	•	If it’s UI text for the EPA Sanity feature → remove with the feature.
	•	If it’s just text or a label → replace with a neutral description like "External EPA model reference" or remove entirely.
	3.	Make sure there is no visible text in the UI and no obvious reference in docs/comments that names him directly.

4. Safety Checks
	1.	After changes:
	•	App should build and run with no TypeScript or runtime errors.
	•	Sidebar should no longer show “EPA Sanity”.
	•	Any direct navigation to the EPA Sanity route should now 404 or no longer exist.
	2.	Confirm that:
	•	team EPA, player EPA, and any other EPA-related tables or services are still present in the codebase.

5. Report Back

When you’re done, please report back with:
	•	Files modified (list)
	•	Endpoints removed (if any)
	•	Confirmation that no "Ben Baldwin" string exists anywhere in the repo
	•	Confirmation that EPA tables / services are untouched.
