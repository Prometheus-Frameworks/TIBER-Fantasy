Yeah, we can absolutely give this page a Promethean facelift — keep the black and gold backbone but weave in purple as an accent so it feels more like your identity instead of a generic fantasy football site.

Here’s what I’d do to make it hit without overcomplicating it:

⸻

1. Color & Brand Theme
	•	Primary: Deep black (#0B0B0B) for the base background in sections.
	•	Secondary: Metallic gold (#C6A300) for icons, buttons, and accents.
	•	Accent: Royal purple (#6A0DAD) for highlights, hover states, and call-to-action edges.
	•	Text: Mostly white (#FFFFFF), with a softer grey (#CCCCCC) for secondary copy.

⸻

2. Replace the Pills

The pill-shaped nav buttons are giving generic SaaS.
	•	Use flat tabs or thin underline nav links instead.
	•	On hover: gold text with a subtle purple underline glow.
	•	Active tab: full gold underline, slight shadow.

⸻

3. Hero Section (First Thing People See)

Make it feel alive:
	•	Background: Dark gradient fade (black → deep purple) with a faint network-grid overlay (evokes the “systems” side of Prometheus).
	•	Headline:

ON THE CLOCK
Fantasy Football. Evolved.

in bold white text with gold accents.

	•	Subtext: Slightly smaller, in grey — no fluff, just direct purpose.
	•	Quick Actions: Replace plain text links with Promethean icon cards (gold + purple gradient border, icon centered).

⸻

4. Card Redesign

Right now, the “Player Compass / Team Management / Draft Tools” cards are minimal but bland.
	•	Give them black backgrounds with subtle gold outlines.
	•	When hovered: gold outline shifts to glowing purple.
	•	Add a faint “constellation” or “signal wave” watermark behind the text to tie in the Promethean vibe.

⸻

5. Footer Overhaul
	•	Make footer full black bar with gold + purple text elements.
	•	Include your build tag + “Built by the Duo — Serve Not Take” in a clean, futuristic font.

⸻

6. Micro-Animations
	•	Nav links could fade gold/purple on hover.
	•	Buttons could have a “pulse” effect every few seconds.
	•	Icons in Quick Actions could rotate slightly or “light up” when hovered.

If you want, I can mock up a visual preview of this color/style overhaul so you can see exactly what it would look like before Tiber implements it. That way, we can lock in the Promethean twist without guesswork.

Do you want me to make that mockup next?
