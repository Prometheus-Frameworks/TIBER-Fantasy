Yeah, Tiber's audit is a sharp, no-BS breakdown—lays out the gaps without fluff and prioritizes fixes that could get this Rookie Risers thing humming quick. It's truth-seeking in how it flags the broken stuff (like those unhealthy endpoints) and doesn't sugarcoat the missing pieces, which lines up with what we've been brainstorming. As a tool, I'll dissect it section-by-section with my take: where it nails it, potential tweaks, and how it meshes with the sources I suggested earlier. Bottom line, this gives us a clear roadmap; we're not starting from zero, but yeah, those 4-5 new endpoints feel spot-on to bridge it.

### 1. Core Rookie Usage (Sleeper API)
Spot on with the haves—having that player pool and weekly infra is a win, means we can build on existing syncs without reinventing the wheel. The missings are legit pain points: Snap %, routes, etc., aren't just nice-to-haves for a usage tracker; they're core for spotting risers like Ayomanor stealing reps. Flag makes sense—aggregating specifically for rookies keeps it focused and efficient. Ties right into my earlier recs: If Sleeper's got the raw data buried, we could enhance the integration (e.g., query their stats endpoints for targets/carries) to feed a new /api/rookies/usage-weekly. No major quibbles; this is high-priority as Tiber says.

### 2. Injury & Depth Chart Context
Good call on the haves—the depth chart arch and roster sync are foundational, so layering injuries on top shouldn't be a total rebuild. Missings are critical: Without Q/D/O/IR tracking, we'd miss opportunity deltas (e.g., a vet like Warren going questionable opens doors for Kaleb Johnson). The static vs. dynamic change detection is a smart flag—week-to-week diffs would make the tracker predictive. Aligns perfectly with my suggestion: nfl-data-py is the way to go for injuries (it's free, Pythonic, and pulls official NFL reports reliably). We could hook it in for /api/injury-reports, then diff against your existing depth charts for changes. RotoWire as backup if we need more narrative blurbs. Solid priority here.

### 3. Beat / News Blurbs
The RAG system's a strong have—97 docs with a 21-day lookback means we can query for coach quotes without starting fresh. Missings are fair: Automated extraction for quotes/roles would elevate it from basic search to actionable (e.g., "Harbaugh says Hampton's earning more early-downs"). Flag's on point—needs feeds to keep it current. This jives with what I proposed: Rotoworld RSS for blurbs (easy ingestion, coach-heavy) as primary, with FantasyLife as backup if their JSON's accessible (worth testing as Tiber notes). We could pipe that into the RAG for scheme notes, making it more than just keyword hits.

### 4. Market Sentiment / Rostership
Haves are promising—the ADP framework's there, even if broken, so fixing that endpoint could unlock deltas quick. Missings hit the nail: Rostership and start % are key for "market lag" (e.g., if Horton's usage spikes but he's only 40% rostered, that's a riser signal). Flag's accurate—without historical trends, it's half-baked. My sources fit seamlessly: Sleeper API might have rostership if we dig (their league endpoints often do), or ffscrapr for ESPN/Yahoo pulls. FantasyPros for ADP deltas is plug-and-play via CSV. Building /api/market-sentiment off that would round it out without much lift.

### 5. Waiver Heat Index Inputs
Totally agree—this is the greenfield area, and calling it completely missing is honest. But it's also the fun part: Quantifying those inputs turns the tracker into a decision tool (e.g., Heat 80+ = bid 20% FAAB). Flag's right—scratch build, but we can skeleton it off the other sections' data. My weighting rec (40% usage growth, etc.) could be the starting formula; test it on mock data from past seasons to calibrate. Once the upstream endpoints (usage, injuries, etc.) are fixed, this flows naturally into /api/rookies/waiver-heat.

Overall, the action items and recs are pragmatic—focus on fixes first, then integrations. Data sources match what I scanned: nfl-data-py for injuries, Sleeper/ESPN for market stuff, Rotoworld/FantasyLife for blurbs. If anything, we could add a quick win: Prototype the Waiver Heat formula in code (maybe via your REPL tool if needed) to validate before full build. What gaps does Tiber see in my source suggestions now that he's reviewing? Let's sync on that next.
