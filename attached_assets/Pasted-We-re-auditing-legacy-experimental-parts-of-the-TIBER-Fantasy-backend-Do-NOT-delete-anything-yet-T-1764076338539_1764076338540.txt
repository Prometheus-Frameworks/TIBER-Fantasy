We’re auditing legacy/experimental parts of the TIBER Fantasy backend.
Do NOT delete anything yet. This pass is for classification and reporting only.

Focus on these targets:

enhancedRankingsRoutes.ts

hotListLive.ts

Rookie risers modules:

rookieRisersRoutes.ts

rookieRisersAPI.ts

rookieRisersTest.ts

pythonRookieRoutes.ts

Strategy / start-sit / matchup experiments:

strategyRoutes.ts

startSitRoutes.ts

matchupRoutes.ts

weeklyTakesRoutes.ts

stats2024Routes.ts

Assume they all live under server/routes/ unless you find otherwise.

1) For each of those files, document:

For every file listed above, tell me:

File Path

All routes defined (method + path, e.g. GET /api/rankings/enhanced, POST /api/strategy/submit)

What each route returns (high level: e.g. “enhanced 0–100 alpha scores”, “2024 weekly stats”, “hot list live feed”, etc.)

Direct imports (services/modules it depends on)

Where it is wired into the app

Check server/routes.ts for how it’s mounted.

Note the base path (e.g. /api/rankings, /api/rookies, /api/matchups).

2) Check if these routes are actually used by the frontend

Search the client/ directory for calls to these routes or obvious variants:

Any fetch, axios, or API helper usage that hits:

/api/rankings/enhanced or similar

/api/hot-list, /api/hotlist, /api/hot-list-live

/api/rookie-risers, /api/rookies/risers, anything containing "rookie-riser"

/api/strategy, /api/start-sit, /api/matchup, /api/matchups

/api/stats/2024, /api/2024/stats, "stats2024"

Also search by file name references in the client code if applicable (e.g. hotListLive, enhancedRankings).

For each route in the audited files, mark:

Used by frontend: yes/no

If yes, list:

The client file(s) that call it (e.g. client/src/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx, TiberDashboard.tsx, etc.)

A short description of how it’s used in the UI (e.g. “feeds a table of enhanced rankings”, “feeds a matchup tool card”, etc.)

3) Classify each file

For each of the files, assign one of these labels:

CORE_ACTIVE

Used by the frontend and clearly part of the current product vision.

LEGACY_BUT_USED

Used somewhere in the frontend, but looks like old/experimental behavior that overlaps with newer systems (e.g. rankings v1 vs rankings v3).

LEGACY_UNUSED

Wired in backend but no frontend calls, or only test/dev tools.

DEAD/TEST_ONLY

Only used by debug scripts, test routes, or not referenced at all.

Add a one–sentence justification per file, e.g.:

enhancedRankingsRoutes.ts → LEGACY_BUT_USED – still feeds a small table on AnalyticsPage but duplicates v3 rankings logic.

hotListLive.ts → LEGACY_UNUSED – routes are mounted but there are no references in client/.

4) Surface any obvious overlaps or redundancy

If you notice obvious duplication, call it out. Examples:

enhancedRankingsRoutes.ts vs rankingsV3.ts

strategyRoutes.ts / startSitRoutes.ts vs newer start/sit engines

stats2024Routes.ts vs any newer stats aggregation you find in silverLayerRoutes.ts / goldLayerRoutes.ts

Just a brief note like:

“stats2024Routes.ts appears redundant with stats2024Routes or silverLayerRoutes because both expose 2024 player stats from the same tables.”

5) Output format

Return a clear, structured report in this format:

## enhancedRankingsRoutes.ts
- Path: server/routes/enhancedRankingsRoutes.ts
- Routes:
  - GET /api/____ → returns ______
  - ...
- Frontend usage:
  - Used in: client/src/pages/____.tsx (describe briefly)
- Classification: LEGACY_BUT_USED
- Notes: (duplication/overlap, anything weird)

That’s it for this pass — no deletions, no refactors yet.
Just map what’s live, what’s legacy, and what’s dead.
