Task: Add Alpha Composite Score to WR Efficiency Admin Sandbox

Goal:
Enhance the existing WR efficiency admin test page by adding an "alphaScore" that blends volume, total fantasy points, and adjusted efficiency into a single 0–100 score. Do NOT touch the main public rankings – this is admin-only diagnostics.

Backend Changes:

1) In the backend endpoint powering the WR efficiency admin table (the one returning Games, Targets, FantasyPts, Pts/Tgt, Sample, AdjPtsPerTarget):

- After you’ve computed:
  - targets
  - fantasyPoints
  - adjustedEfficiency

  First, compute three normalized indices across the result set:

  - Let maxTargets = max(targets) among all WRs in the query
  - Let maxFantasyPoints = max(fantasyPoints) among all WRs in the query
  - Let maxAdjEff = max(adjustedEfficiency) among all WRs in the query

  For each WR row, compute:

  volumeIndex = targets / maxTargets
  pointsIndex = fantasyPoints / maxFantasyPoints
  efficiencyIndex = adjustedEfficiency / maxAdjEff

  Then compute:

  alphaScoreRaw =
    0.45 * volumeIndex +
    0.35 * pointsIndex +
    0.20 * efficiencyIndex;

  alphaScore = Math.round(alphaScoreRaw * 100);

2) Add these fields to the JSON response per WR:

  - volumeIndex
  - pointsIndex
  - efficiencyIndex
  - alphaScore

3) Change the default ORDER BY for this endpoint to:

  - ORDER BY alphaScore DESC, adjustedEfficiency DESC

  (We still want adjustedEfficiency to matter as the tie-breaker.)

Frontend Changes:

1) In the React component that renders the WR admin sandbox table:

  - Add a new column: "Alpha Score (0–100)" that displays alphaScore.
  - Keep the existing "Adj Pts/Tgt" column as-is.
  - Optional but nice: show a small tag in the header like:
    "Alpha Score blends volume, total fantasy points, and adjusted efficiency."

2) Confirm that after this change:

  - High-volume, high-scoring WRs (JSN, ARSB, Chase, Puka, Lamb, etc.) appear near the top.
  - Low-volume spike guys (e.g. 30–40 targets) can still appear high, but won’t eclipse true workhorse alphas unless they are insanely efficient.

Validation:

After implementing:

  - Log out the top 15 WRs with: Player, Targets, FantasyPts, AdjPtsPerTarget, alphaScore.
  - Sanity-check that:
      - Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Amon-Ra St. Brown, CeeDee Lamb, Puka Nacua, Ja'Marr Chase are all inside the top cluster.
      - Jameson Williams is still ranked well (he’s playing great), but not clearly above every true alpha.
