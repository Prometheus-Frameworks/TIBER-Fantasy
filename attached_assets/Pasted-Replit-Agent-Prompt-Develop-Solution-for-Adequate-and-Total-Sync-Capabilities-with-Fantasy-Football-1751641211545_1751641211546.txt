Replit Agent Prompt: Develop Solution for Adequate and Total Sync Capabilities with Fantasy Football Platforms like Sleeper
Task: Create a robust solution for the fantasy football app to achieve adequate and total sync capabilities with popular fantasy football platforms, starting with Sleeper, to enhance real-time data integration, rankings, and user experience. The goal is to ensure seamless data flow (e.g., player stats, rankings, roster updates) between our app and external platforms, addressing current limitations in sync reliability and depth.
Steps:
1.  Research Sync Requirements: Analyze Sleeper’s API documentation (e.g., https://docs.sleeper.app/) to understand available endpoints for league data, player stats, and real-time updates.
2.  API Integration: Develop a secure connection to Sleeper’s API using authentication (e.g., OAuth or API tokens). Test endpoints for league sync, including rosters, scoring settings, and transaction history.
3.  Data Mapping: Map Sleeper’s data fields (e.g., player IDs, fantasy points, matchup scores) to our app’s database schema, ensuring compatibility with existing offensive player rankings (QB, RB, WR, TE).
4.  Real-Time Sync: Implement a real-time sync mechanism (e.g., WebSocket or polling) to update player stats, rankings, and roster changes as they occur on Sleeper, minimizing latency.
5.  Validation and Error Handling: Build validation to detect sync failures (e.g., missing data, rate limits) and implement fallback mechanisms (e.g., cached data or manual sync options).
6.  Testing: Test sync with a sample Sleeper league, verifying accuracy against manual data checks. Include edge cases like mid-season trades, bye weeks, and player injuries.
7.  Expansion Plan: Design a framework to extend sync capabilities to other platforms (e.g., ESPN, Yahoo) using similar API integration patterns.
Implementation Notes:
•  Use Python with requests, websocket-client, and pandas for API calls and data processing.
•  Ensure compliance with Sleeper’s API usage policies (e.g., rate limits, data usage restrictions).
•  Integrate with the app’s existing database (per July 3, 2025 discussion) for real-time updates to rankings and user interfaces.
•  Log sync events and errors for troubleshooting (e.g., “Sync failed: Rate limit exceeded at 10:59 AM EDT, July 04, 2025”).
•  Prioritize security (e.g., encrypt API credentials, use HTTPS).
Deliverable:
•  Script (sleeper_sync.py):
	•  Establishes API connection to Sleeper.
	•  Syncs league data, player stats, and rankings in real-time.
	•  Updates app database and exports JSON (sleeper_sync_data.json).
•  Console: Display sync status and sample synced data (e.g., top 5 QB rankings from Sleeper).
•  Documentation: Include setup guide and API endpoint usage notes.
