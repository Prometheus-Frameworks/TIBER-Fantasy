Task: Remove roleLeverage SubScore
Context
The roleLeverage subScore currently returns 50 (neutral) for all players because the underlying fetchRoleMetrics() function isn't wired to real data. Rather than implement it, we're removing it entirely to simplify the model.
Task
1. Remove roleLeverage from subScore calculations
Files likely affected:

server/modules/forge/alphaEngine.ts — main scoring logic
server/modules/forge/types.ts — type definitions, weight configs
server/modules/forge/features/wrFeatures.ts
server/modules/forge/features/rbFeatures.ts
server/modules/forge/features/teFeatures.ts
server/modules/forge/features/qbFeatures.ts
server/modules/forge/context/contextFetcher.ts — fetchRoleMetrics() can be removed or deprecated

2. Redistribute weights
Current weights (from audit doc):
SubScoreWRRBTEQBvolume0.350.380.300.25efficiency0.300.250.280.35roleLeverage0.180.200.250.15stability0.120.120.100.10contextFit0.050.050.070.15
Redistribute roleLeverage weight proportionally across the remaining four. New weights should sum to 1.00.
Suggested redistribution (proportional):
WR (removing 0.18):

volume: 0.35 → 0.43
efficiency: 0.30 → 0.37
stability: 0.12 → 0.15
contextFit: 0.05 → 0.05

RB (removing 0.20):

volume: 0.38 → 0.475
efficiency: 0.25 → 0.31
stability: 0.12 → 0.15
contextFit: 0.05 → 0.065

TE (removing 0.25):

volume: 0.30 → 0.40
efficiency: 0.28 → 0.37
stability: 0.10 → 0.13
contextFit: 0.07 → 0.10

QB (removing 0.15):

volume: 0.25 → 0.29
efficiency: 0.35 → 0.41
stability: 0.10 → 0.12
contextFit: 0.15 → 0.18

Verify all weights sum to 1.00 after redistribution.
3. Update API responses
Remove roleLeverage from the subScores object in all FORGE endpoint responses. The response should only include:
json"subScores": {
  "volume": number,
  "efficiency": number,
  "stability": number,
  "contextFit": number
}
4. Clean up dead code

Remove or comment out fetchRoleMetrics() in contextFetcher.ts
Remove any role-related metric calculations that are no longer used
Remove roleLeverage from any TypeScript interfaces/types

5. Re-run calibration check
After removal, the raw alpha distribution will shift since we're removing a subScore that was contributing 50 to everyone. Run the distribution endpoint for all positions and verify the calibration still produces sensible output. May need minor calibration adjustments.
Acceptance Criteria

 roleLeverage removed from all subScore calculations
 Weights redistributed and sum to 1.00 for each position
 API responses no longer include roleLeverage in subScores
 Dead code cleaned up (fetchRoleMetrics, role metric types)
 All four positions spot-checked — rankings still sensible
 No TypeScript errors or broken imports
