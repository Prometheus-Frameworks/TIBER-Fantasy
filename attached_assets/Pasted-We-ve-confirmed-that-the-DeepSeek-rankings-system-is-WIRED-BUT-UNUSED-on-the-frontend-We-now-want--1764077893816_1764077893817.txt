We’ve confirmed that the DeepSeek rankings system is WIRED_BUT_UNUSED on the frontend.

We now want to remove the entire DeepSeek rankings surface and its dedicated plumbing, while keeping anything genuinely reusable for the future.

This is a delete + cleanup task.

1) Delete Frontend DeepSeek Artifacts

Delete these files from the client:

client/src/hooks/useDeepseekV3.ts

client/src/components/RankingsV3Table.tsx

These are not imported anywhere and are safe to remove.

After deletion:

Remove any leftover DeepSeek-related exports or barrel imports (if they exist in any index.ts/index.tsx files).

Confirm there are no references to useDeepseekV3 or RankingsV3Table anywhere in client/.

2) Delete Backend DeepSeek Rankings Routes

Delete the main DeepSeek rankings router:

server/routes/rankingsV3.ts

Then update server/routes.ts:

Remove the import:

import rankingsV3Router from './routes/rankingsV3';


Remove the mount:

app.use('/api', rankingsV3Router);


Confirm there are no remaining references to rankingsV3Router or /api/rankings/deepseek/* anywhere in the repo.

3) Audit and Clean DeepSeek-Specific Services

Now audit the following backend services that were reported as supporting DeepSeek rankings:

server/services/deepseekV3Service.ts

server/services/deepseekV3.1Service.ts

server/services/rankingsFusionService.ts

server/services/sleeperDataNormalizationService.ts

server/services/marketEngine.ts

server/services/riskEngine.ts

server/services/bulletproofCombiner.ts

server/src/modules/ratings/compute.ts

Any DeepSeek-related QA files under server/qa/

For each of these files:

Search the entire repo for imports of that file.

If a file is only imported by rankingsV3.ts (which you just deleted), and nowhere else:

Delete that service file as well.

If a file is imported by other active modules (e.g. used by OVR, Compass, sandboxes, or anything not being deleted):

Do NOT delete it.

Just leave it as a reusable shared utility.

The goal is:

Remove DeepSeek-specific plumbing that is now orphaned.

Keep any utility that has broader use in the system.

4) Clean Up Orphaned Imports and Types

After deleting the route and any services that are now unused:

Run the project’s TypeScript build / type-check (or the repo’s usual build command).

Fix any compile errors caused by:

Missing imports from deleted services

Types or functions referenced from removed files

For any remaining DeepSeek references (e.g. strings like "deepseek", "v3.1", "Fusion") that now point to nothing:

Remove those references or refactor the code so there are no broken imports or dead constants.

5) Preserve Non-DeepSeek Intelligence Systems

Do NOT modify or delete any of the following:

ovrRoutes.ts

compassQbRoute.ts, compassRbRoute.ts, compassWrRoute.ts, compassTeRoute.ts

Any of the sandbox-related pages:

QBRankingsSandbox.tsx

WRRankingsSandbox.tsx

RB/TE sandbox components

Any TIBER-specific routes:

tiberRoutes.ts

tiberDataRoutes.ts

tiberMemoryRoutes.ts

analyticsRoutes.ts

redraftWeeklyRoutes.ts

strategyRoutes.ts

matchupRoutes.ts

weeklyTakesRoutes.ts

We are only removing the old DeepSeek rankings implementation, not the current TIBER / Compass / Sandbox / OVR systems.

6) Final Verification

After all deletions and cleanup:

Confirm the app builds and starts without errors.

Confirm there are no remaining HTTP endpoints under:

/api/rankings/deepseek/*

Confirm there are no remaining imports or references to:

useDeepseekV3

RankingsV3Table

rankingsV3Router

deepseekV3Service

deepseekV3.1Service

rankingsFusionService (unless still in use elsewhere)

Confirm all existing core features still function:

OVR tab

Tiber Dashboard tabs

Analytics/leaders pages

Sandboxes (WR/RB/TE/QB)

7) Report Back

When finished, please provide a summary:

List of all files deleted

List of imports removed from server/routes.ts

List of additional services deleted (if any)

Confirmation that:

The build passes

The server runs

No /api/rankings/deepseek/* URLs are exposed anymore

That’s all for this pass.
We’re intentionally removing the DeepSeek rankings system entirely while keeping any generic utilities that are still used by the rest of the app.
