I’d change one thing in your label logic (small but important). Right now it’s:

BUY_LOW if rankZ >= 1 OR displayPct >= 20
SELL_HIGH if rankZ <= -1 OR displayPct <= -20

That “OR” can mislabel edge cases when the eligible pool is small or skewed (TEs especially). A percentile-only trigger can also fire on weird distributions even if z-score says “meh.”

Better rule:
	•	Primary: rankZ (because it’s robust)
	•	Secondary: displayPct only if the player passes “confidence” conditions (games played in window + snaps_R)

So, keep OR, but gate the percentile trigger:

BUY_LOW if rankZ >= 1 OR (displayPct >= 20 AND confidence != LOW)
SELL_HIGH if rankZ <= -1 OR (displayPct <= -20 AND confidence != LOW)

That keeps the “intuitive” path while preventing goofy false positives.

Second, add two tiny fields that will make the whole product feel honest.
	1.	window_games_played
Count of weeks in the rolling window where snaps > 0 (or targets+carries > 0 if snaps missing). This immediately catches “he missed 2 games” inflation.
	2.	confidence
HIGH/MED/LOW based on:

	•	games played
	•	snaps_R thresholds margin
	•	missingness flags (routes missing, etc.)

Example:
	•	HIGH: games_played >= 4 and snaps_R >= threshold*1.5
	•	MED: games_played >= 3 and snaps_R >= threshold
	•	LOW: games_played <= 2 OR snaps_R barely clears threshold

Then in UI, show a small badge. This is the “don’t bullshit me” layer.

Third, make Delta explain itself in one glance.

Add a small “why” object to each row (no LLM, just computed facts):

why: {
forge_vs_fire: “High FORGE%, low FIRE% over rolling 4w”,
window: “W11–W14”,
xfp_r: 17.5,
snaps_r: 150,
top_role_driver: “targets down” or “routes down” (if you can infer)
}

Even just xfp_R + snaps_R + games_played is enough to make people trust it.

Fourth, lock your cache key the right way.

Since you’re reading precomputed FORGE, ensure the cache is keyed by:
	•	season
	•	week anchor
	•	orientation/mode (redraft/dynasty/bestball)
	•	position
	•	scoring preset/weights (if those exist)

Otherwise you’ll get spooky “why did Jacobs change when I toggled dynasty” bugs.

Fifth, one last sanity suite I’d automate (takes like 30 mins, saves you hours later).

Add a tiny integration test script that:
	•	hits /api/fire/eg/batch for 3 weeks and checks counts > 0
	•	hits /api/delta/eg/batch and checks sorting is abs(rankZ) desc
	•	asserts no QBs returned
	•	asserts displayPct is between -100 and +100
	•	asserts rankZ is finite (no NaN/Inf)

That’s your “this engine didn’t silently rot” alarm.
