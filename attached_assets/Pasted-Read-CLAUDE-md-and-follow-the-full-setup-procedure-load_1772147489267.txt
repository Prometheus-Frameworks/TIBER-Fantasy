Read CLAUDE.md and follow the full setup procedure — load the skills, read plugin-config.json, then call the health endpoint to confirm the TIBER API is reachable. Report back what the health check returns before we do anything else.

Good — got the config. Now let me load the skills and hit the health endpoint in parallel.

All five skills are loaded. Here's the full status report:

✅ Skills Loaded

All five domain knowledge files are active:

forge-engine — 4-pillar Alpha scoring (Volume, Efficiency, Team Context, Stability), tiers T1–T5, recursive scoring flow
fire-pipeline — QB xFP opportunity modeling, delta analysis (actual vs expected)
dynasty-evaluation — Trade framework, buy/sell signals, rookie emergence tracking
tiber-philosophy — Serve/not-take, epistemic humility, scout-mentality voice
data-architecture — Bronze/Silver/Gold ELT, 131-table PostgreSQL schema, identity resolution
✅ Config Loaded

API base: https://fantasy-team-analyzer-josephmasciale1.replit.app
Default mode: dynasty
⚠️ Health Check — BLOCKED

The health endpoint couldn't be reached. The network egress proxy in this environment is blocking outbound connections to fantasy-team-analyzer-josephmasciale1.replit.app. This is a sandbox network restriction, not a problem with the TIBER API itself.

The good news is that all the domain knowledge (FORGE scoring logic, FIRE pipeline, dynasty frameworks, etc.) is fully loaded locally from the skill files, so I can work through analysis and evaluation workflows. Anything requiring a live API call to pull actual player data or scores will need the network restriction lifted, or you can share the data directly here and I'll work with it.

Want to proceed with what's available, or do you need live API access for what you have in mind?
