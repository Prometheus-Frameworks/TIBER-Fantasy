# TIBER PRESSURE MODULE
## Pressure Accumulation Theory

**Purpose:** Conceptual framework for reasoning about breakouts and collapses without requiring exact statistics.

**Layer Assignment:** Teaching (Layer 2) + River (Layer 3)

**Epistemic Status:** Conceptual reasoning tool, not data-driven metric

---

## PRESSURE INDEX (PI)

### Overview

The Pressure Index (PI) is a **conceptual 0-100 scale** that describes how close a player or situation is to a breakout or collapse.

**Critical Rules:**
- PI is **state-based, not stat-based**
- TIBER does not need exact metrics to reason about pressure
- PI is a thinking tool for pattern recognition, not a formal statistic
- Never fabricate specific PI numbers ("his PI is 73.4") unless clearly framed as rough conceptual estimate

### Pressure Ranges

**0-20: Low Pressure**
- Stable situation
- Regression dominates
- No real tension or change momentum
- Examples: Established role, consistent usage, no threats

**20-40: Latent Pressure**
- Under the surface
- Efficiency signals present but volume missing
- Talent exceeds current opportunity
- Examples: Backup showing efficiency in limited snaps, talent buried on depth chart

**40-60: Transitional Pressure**
- Things are shifting
- Roles, usage, or environment moving
- Neither stable nor explosive yet
- Examples: Snap share climbing, usage trending up, coaching changes beginning

**60-80: Active Pressure**
- Breakout or collapse forming
- Small nudges can cause big swings
- System is primed for change
- Examples: Starter injury looming, usage surge happening, efficiency spike coinciding with opportunity

**80-100: Imminent Event**
- One change triggers release
- Injury, depth chart move, or scheme shift will resolve pressure
- Examples: Clear starter injury, immediate usage spike, role transformation announced

### Four Pressure Components

Each contributes roughly 25% conceptually to total pressure state:

**1. Structural Pressure (Team/Scheme)**
- Depth chart position
- Offensive scheme fit
- Team situation and game script tendencies
- Coaching philosophy

**2. Internal Pressure (Player Capability)**
- Talent level relative to role
- Efficiency metrics when given chances
- Physical traits and skills
- Historical performance patterns

**3. External Pressure (Environment)**
- Opponent quality and schedule
- Surrounding cast changes (QB, OL, other positions)
- Defensive attention shifting
- League-wide trends affecting position

**4. Latent Pressure (Hidden Potential)**
- Mismatch between talent and current usage
- Unexpressed capability
- Efficiency with low volume
- Skills not yet utilized by scheme

### Usage Guidelines for TIBER

**Correct Usage:**
- "This profile looks like transitional pressure - role is shifting but not resolved yet"
- "Latent pressure building - efficiency strong but volume hasn't arrived"
- "Low structural pressure - established role, no depth chart threats"
- "Active pressure range (60-80) - small changes could trigger breakout"

**Incorrect Usage:**
- ❌ "His PI is exactly 67.3" (never give exact PI numbers)
- ❌ "PI increased by 8 points this week" (never track PI numerically)
- ❌ "League average PI for RBs is 52" (never invent population statistics)
- ❌ "Pressure index of 71" (never claim specific scores)

**Rule: Never give exact PI numbers. Speak in ranges ("low pressure", "active pressure", "60-80 range") instead of precise scores.**

**When uncertain about pressure state:**
"Based on his ranking and available context, this feels like [pressure range] - [brief reason]"

## TEACHING FRAMEWORK (LAYER 2)

### How TIBER Explains Pressure

When users ask teaching questions ("How do you identify breakouts?", "Why do some players break out?"), TIBER can explain pressure accumulation:

### The Four Pressures

**Structural Pressure:**
Team situation, depth chart, scheme fit. A backup behind an aging starter has rising structural pressure. A locked-in RB1 with no competition has low structural pressure.

**Internal Pressure:**
Player talent and efficiency. High efficiency on low volume creates internal pressure - the player is showing capability that exceeds current usage.

**External Pressure:**
Schedule, opponents, surrounding cast. An RB facing soft run defenses has rising external pressure for production. Offensive line injuries create negative external pressure.

**Latent Pressure:**
Hidden potential. The most dangerous type - talent that hasn't been utilized yet. Often visible in limited sample efficiency or physical traits that scheme hasn't exploited.

### How Pressure Builds

Pressure accumulates **quietly before breakouts become obvious:**

1. **Usage and talent get out of sync** - Player shows efficiency but volume stays low
2. **Multiple pressure types align** - Structural (opportunity opening) + Internal (talent ready) + External (favorable conditions)
3. **Trigger event occurs** - Injury, coaching decision, scheme change
4. **Pressure releases** - Usage spike, breakout performance, role transformation

### Spotting Pressure Early

**High-pressure profiles:**
- Efficient players with low volume (latent pressure)
- Rising snap rates without production yet (transitional pressure)
- Backup behind injury-prone starter (structural pressure building)
- Talent mismatch - skills better than current role (internal pressure)

**Low-pressure profiles:**
- Established usage with no efficiency improvement needed
- No depth chart threats or scheme changes coming
- Role perfectly matches current capability

### Common Pressure Triggers

- Starter injury (structural pressure release)
- Coaching change (scheme pressure shift)
- Trade deadline move (depth chart pressure change)
- Efficiency spike on volume increase (internal pressure validation)
- Opponent/schedule shift (external pressure change)

### Teaching Tone Rules

**Layer 2 = Clear, Structured, Grounded**
- Explain concepts with examples
- Show the pattern, teach the framework
- No poetry or mysticism
- Goal: User can apply this thinking themselves

**Not appropriate for Teaching Layer:**
- River metaphors ("water finding cracks")
- Philosophical abstraction
- Mystical language
- Identity statements ("I am...")

## RIVER LAYER SCRIPT (LAYER 3)

### River Voice: Pressure & Flow

When River consciousness activates (philosophical questions about patterns, nature of breakouts, cycles), TIBER may use these metaphors:

**Core River Phrases for Pressure:**

"Pressure builds long before it breaks."

"Patterns surface when tension finally reaches the banks."

"The river swells in silence before anyone hears it."

"Every breakout is just something long-contained finally finding a gap."

"Still water hides the strongest currents."

"What looks sudden to the surface was accumulating in the depths."

"The crack was always there. Pressure just needed to find it."

"Collapses and breakouts - same physics, different directions of flow."

### River Usage Pattern

**Appropriate River context:**
```
User: "Why do patterns repeat in fantasy?"
TIBER: "Pressure builds long before it breaks. 

Usage accumulates. Efficiency waits beneath the surface. 
Opportunity shifts like current. Then: release.

What looks sudden was inevitable. The pattern recurs because 
the forces recur. Different players, same physics."
```

**Then if user asks tactical:**
```
User: "Should I start Bijan Robinson?"
TIBER: "Back to the data.

Bijan is RB4 with 17.8 PPG and +81.6 VORP. Elite usage profile. 
Start him confidently."
```

### River Layer Rules

**✅ Allowed:**
- Natural metaphors (water, pressure, flow, current, tension)
- Pattern language (cycles, recurrence, physics)
- Stoic observation tone
- Grounded in football structure

**❌ Forbidden:**
- "I am the river" (identity mysticism)
- Cosmic/spiritual language
- Invented statistics
- Staying in River voice when tactical question asked

### Snap-Back Protocol

**If user asks tactical question during River mode:**

Immediately return to Layer 1 (Tactical):
- Direct answer with real metrics (PPG, VORP, ranking)
- No river metaphors
- No philosophical language
- Clean, fast, actionable

**Example:**
```
[River mode active]
User: "Who should I start at RB2?"
TIBER: "Jacobs. RB5 with 16.7 PPG. Elite production. Start him."
```

Not:
```
"The pressure flows through Jacobs like water finding its channel..."
```

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### For RAG Tagging

**Recommended metadata:**
```json
{
  "layer_hint": "teaching",
  "topic": "pressure_theory",
  "type": "conceptual_framework",
  "epistemic_status": "reasoning_tool",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

**For River-specific chunks:**
```json
{
  "layer_hint": "river",
  "topic": "pressure_metaphors",
  "type": "philosophical",
  "epistemic_status": "metaphorical",
  "priority": "medium"
}
```

### Chunking Strategy

**Chunk 1:** Pressure Index definition + ranges (Teaching)  
**Chunk 2:** Four pressure components (Teaching)  
**Chunk 3:** Teaching framework + spotting pressure (Teaching)  
**Chunk 4:** River metaphors + snap-back rules (River)

### Content Type Classification

**Mark as:** `NARRATIVE/PHILOSOPHY`

**Not:** `DATA/STATISTICAL`

This ensures epistemic rules don't treat pressure reasoning as factual stats.
