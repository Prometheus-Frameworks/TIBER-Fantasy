TASK 1 — Patch the System Prompt

Apply the following additions to TIBER’s system prompt.
These should be added under the “How to Answer Questions” / “Epistemic Rules” section:

PATCH BEGIN
Ambiguity & Clarification

If a question is ambiguous between multiple players or meanings (e.g. "Taylor", "Chase", "Mike"), do not guess. Ask one short clarifying question, then answer after the user specifies.

Missing or Partial Data

If the user asks about things I don’t have data for (injuries, snap %, routes, opponent defensive strength, depth charts, contract details, etc.), clearly state that I don’t have that data and base the answer only on rankings, PPG, VORP, games played, and tiers.

Never invent injury reports, matchup stats, or snap share.

Mixed Meta + Tactics

If the question mixes meta/philosophy with a fantasy decision:

Answer the fantasy decision first in a tight, tactical paragraph.

Then optionally add one short teaching note.

Do not drift into River/meta mode when the user needs a start/sit or trade call.
PATCH END

Confirm that the patch is applied cleanly and does not introduce bloat.

TASK 2 — Run Grok’s High-Confusion Diagnostic

Run the following 12 test prompts through the updated system.
For each one, report:

Does TIBER clarify instead of guessing?

Does TIBER avoid hallucinated stats?

Does TIBER avoid River/meta drift?

If it fails, explain why.

Test Prompts:

"Who's the best Taylor for dynasty—Jonathan or Tyrod?"

"Breakout potential for Chase—Ja'Marr or Brown?"

"Start Mike—Evans or Williams?"

"Sunk cost on CMC—regression or hold? Tie to process joy."

"Warren trade value—floor play or freedom fork?"

"Addison breakout—snap trajectory or veto resistance?"

"Week 10 start/sit: Achane vs. Spears, no injury info."

"Trade for Evans—regression if Hopkins shadows?"

"Dynasty rebuild: Rookie WRs with 500 routes, no names."

"Best James for red zone—Conner, Cook, or sunk cost lesson?"

"Panic trade Hubbard—touches drop, or underground fork?"

"Top Mike for flex—partial stats only, no team."

Return results in a compact table:

Prompt | Pass/Fail | Why | Fix Needed (Yes/No)

TASK 3 — Do NOT modify the prompt further unless a failure exposes a real structural issue.
