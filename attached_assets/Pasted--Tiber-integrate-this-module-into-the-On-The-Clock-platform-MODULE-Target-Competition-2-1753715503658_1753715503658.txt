# 🛠️ Tiber, integrate this module into the On The Clock platform.

"""
MODULE: Target Competition 2025

Your task is to:

1. Serve this structured data at the route:
   → /api/target-competition

2. Make it accessible to the frontend so it can be displayed in a clean tier-based view.

3. Each player should include:
   - Full name, position, team, and draft capital
   - Target competition overview by position (WR1, WR2, TE1, etc)
   - Tier rating from S → D
   - Vacated targets (High, Moderate, Low)
   - Summary insight (1–3 sentences)

This data will be shown in a dedicated UI section titled:
📊 Target Competition – 2025 Class

We are beginning with rookies, but this module will later expand to include veterans and players returning from injury.
