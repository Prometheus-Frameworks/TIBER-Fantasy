📦 Handoff Staging (Ready for Tiber to pull)

1) Grok → Tiber (already handed off; working)
	•	Artifacts: defense_dvp_2024.csv, schedule_2024.csv, dvp_rolling_2024.csv
	•	Action: Load CSVs → Postgres, then replace seed reads with DB queries (Knex/node‑pg).
	•	Doc: docs/Grok-to-Tiber-handoff.md (we drafted this already).

2) DeepSeek → Tiber (NEW)

DeepSeek’s plan overlaps our schema. We’re not creating duplicate tables. Map as follows:

Schema alignment (use what we already built)
	•	Use defense_dvp (has season, week, def_team, position, fp_allowed, last4_avg)
↳ Covers DeepSeek’s defense_vs_position.
	•	Use schedule (has season, week, home, away)
↳ Covers schedule needs.
	•	Do not add a separate sos_rankings table in v1. We compute on the fly and cache later if needed.

Endpoint mapping (DeepSeek’s paths → our paths)
	•	DeepSeek: GET /api/sos/:position (ROS) → Use: GET /api/sos/ros?position=RB&startWeek=1&window=5&season=2024
	•	DeepSeek: GET /api/sos/:position/:week (weekly) → Use: GET /api/sos/weekly?position=RB&week=1&season=2024

Frontend notes
	•	Page stays /sos with position + week selectors.
	•	Optional later: add a season select (default 2024 until 2025 games exist).
	•	Recharts chart is nice-to-have; ship table first (we already stubbed).

Tiber’s concrete tasks from DeepSeek #1
	•	Confirm no defense_vs_position / sos_rankings tables are created.
	•	Keep our service blending (0.6 last4 + 0.4 season avg) + percentile scaling + tiers.
	•	Ensure endpoints match our controller signature (query params, not path params).
	•	Optional: add /docs/SOS-how-it-works.md (Claude’s doc) and link it from the /sos page footer.

PR Title (copy/paste):
feat(SOS): align DeepSeek spec to existing DB + finalize endpoints

PR Checklist (inside description):
	•	No new tables added (reuse defense_dvp, schedule)
	•	/api/sos/weekly + /api/sos/ros return live data
	•	Percentile 0–100 + tiering (green ≥67, yellow 33–66, red <33)
	•	/sos renders from DB (no seed)
	•	Basic smoke tests pass (2024 Wk1)

🧭 Single Source of Truth (keep us sane)
	•	DB: defense_dvp, schedule (Grok feeds)
	•	API: /api/sos/weekly, /api/sos/ros (Tiber owns)
	•	Docs: docs/SOS-how-it-works.md (Claude owns)
	•	UI: /sos (Tiber owns)

If DeepSeek ships extra ideas (new tables, alt endpoints), we route them to v2 backlog, not v1 scope creep.
