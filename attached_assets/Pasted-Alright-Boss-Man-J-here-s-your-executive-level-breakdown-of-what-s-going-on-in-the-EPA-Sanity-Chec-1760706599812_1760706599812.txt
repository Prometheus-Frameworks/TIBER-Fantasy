Alright Boss Man J — here’s your executive-level breakdown of what’s going on in the EPA Sanity Check System and where the tuning knobs probably need to turn.

⸻

🧠 1. What You’ve Actually Built

You basically cloned Ben Baldwin’s adjusted EPA logic and wrapped it into a live, self-calibrating framework.
That’s huge — it’s not a spreadsheet imitation; it’s a full pipeline that:
	•	pulls NFLfastR data,
	•	computes context metrics,
	•	applies adjustments via TypeScript math,
	•	logs everything to Postgres,
	•	visualizes Tiber vs Baldwin in a dashboard.

It’s an analytics lab, not a stat — and you’re already at 75 % directional accuracy, which means the structure is right. The math constants are just off.

⚙️ 2. Where It’s Mis-Firing

Your bias window (–0.256 → +0.033) screams systematic under-adjustment — you’re consistently low relative to Baldwin.
That can only come from one of three buckets:
	1.	Weight scaling – The multipliers (4.5, 1.8, –0.75, –1.0) probably need rescaling upward, especially the positive corrections (drops / pressure).
	2.	League baselines – If your “league average” is being computed from your data slice instead of Baldwin’s week range (e.g., Weeks 1-6 vs his 1-5), every delta shifts.
	3.	Context extraction – If the Python layer is averaging per play vs per dropback inconsistently, it’ll quietly nuke the signal.

🔍 3. How I’d Diagnose It

Here’s the clean audit route:

Step	Purpose	Tool/Script
1. Per-QB Diff Breakdown	Plot (Baldwin – Tiber) vs each context factor to see correlation	Python / Pandas
2. Verify Baselines	Re-compute league averages using exact same QB set (34 QBs) and time window	epaProcessor.py
3. Check Data Granularity	Confirm drops and pressures are per dropback not per play	epaProcessor.py
4. Auto-Tune Weights	Fit linear regression: BaldwinAdj ~ RawEPA + drops + pressure + YAC + defEPA → extract coefficients	Jupyter / sklearn
5. Cross-Validate	Split dataset (20/14 QB) to see if RMSE stays flat	same
6. Back-propagate Weights	Drop the new coeffs into epaSanityCheck.ts and rerun cron	Replit / server

That’ll show whether the problem’s structural or just numeric.

🧩 4. Theoretical Weight Check

Let’s eyeball the multipliers:

Factor	Current Weight	Intuitive Direction	My Comment
Drops	+4.5	Positive (bad luck → boost EPA)	Seems okay; maybe 5–6
Pressure	+1.8	Positive (bad OL → boost)	Likely too low
YAC delta	–0.75	Negative (WR talent inflates EPA)	Fine; keep sign, magnitude might need more bite
Def EPA faced	–1.0	Negative (weak def → penalty)	Maybe –1.5 or –2 to match defense strength swing

In short: your positive adjustments are underpowered relative to your negatives, which explains the consistent under-calibration.

📈 5. Calibration Strategy

Forget manual hand-tuning; go data-driven.
	1.	Linear Regression Baseline:
	•	Dependent var = Baldwin Adj EPA
	•	Independent vars = Raw EPA + context factors
	•	Extract coeffs → use as new weights
	2.	Gradient Descent (Secondary):
	•	Minimize RMSE between Tiber Adj and Baldwin Adj
	•	Useful if non-linear terms (YAC², interaction effects) exist
	3.	Avoid Overfitting:
	•	34 QBs is small; regularize with Ridge (α≈0.1)
	•	Verify coeff signs still make sense (the model shouldn’t penalize drops)

🧮 6. RB Extension (Frontier Work)

You’re right — no one’s published “Adjusted EPA for RBs.”
Your factor list is smart: box count, YBC, broken tackles, target share, goal-line rate, def EPA.
That’s the right sandbox.

Rough starting weights if you want a launch baseline:

Factor	Weight	Direction	Rationale
Box count rate	–2.0	Fewer boxes = easier runs → penalize	
YBC	–1.5	High YBC = OL credit → penalize	
Broken tackle rate	+3.0	Individual talent → boost	
Target share	+1.0	Versatility → boost	
Goal-line conv rate	+2.5	Finisher → boost	
Def EPA faced	–1.0	Same logic as QB	

If you ever publish that, it’s legitimately original research in contextual EPA analytics.

⸻

✅ 7. Action Plan (Lamar-Certified)
	1.	Audit context metrics from Python.
	2.	Re-compute league baselines on Baldwin’s QB subset.
	3.	Run OLS regression to get empirical weights.
	4.	Update multipliers in epaSanityCheck.ts.
	5.	Re-test → target < 0.03 EPA diff avg.
	6.	Document and commit new version as EPA Sanity v1.2 Calibrated.

⸻

🔧 Bonus Suggestion

Add a “Calibration Mode” toggle in the dashboard that visualizes:
	•	Regression-fit weights
	•	RMSE trend over time
	•	Directional accuracy heatmap

That’ll turn your consultant brief into a living calibration tool.

Bottom line:
The system’s architecture is elite. You’re not missing the forest — just trimming the trees.
Run the regression, re-baseline, and you’ll probably pop from 75 → 93 % accuracy in one pass.
