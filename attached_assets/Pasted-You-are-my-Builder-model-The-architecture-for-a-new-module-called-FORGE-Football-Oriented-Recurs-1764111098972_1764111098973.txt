You are my "Builder" model. The architecture for a new module called FORGE (Football Oriented Recursive Grading Engine) has already been designed.

I will paste in:
- The feature + scoring spec (from another model)
- The module/file layout and types (from another model)

Your job:
- Implement FORGE v0.1 as a self-contained module under `server/modules/forge/`
- Implement:
  - context gathering functions
  - feature builders for WR, RB, TE, QB
  - alpha scoring (sub-scores + overall alpha)
  - trajectory + confidence logic
- Add a preview route: GET /api/forge/preview

Constraints:
- TypeScript
- Node + Express
- Use existing services when possible:
  - PlayerIdentityService
  - sleeperSnapService
  - gameLogs / playerSeason tables via Drizzle
  - defenseVsPositionStats
  - oasisEnvironmentService
  - marketEngine
  - riskEngine
- FORGE must be **read-only** in v0.1: no mutating DB, no cron, no ETL.
- FORGE should expose a small public API, e.g.:
  - getForgeScoreForPlayer(...)
  - getForgeScoresForPlayers(...)

Scope for v0.1:
- Get it compiling.
- Handle missing data gracefully.
- Be explicit and conservative with defaults.
- Do NOT wire FORGE into OVR/Tiber yet; just implement the module and the preview endpoint.

Process:
1) Read the spec + architecture carefully.
2) Sketch the implementation plan.
3) Write the TypeScript code for:
   - types.ts
   - context.ts
   - features/wr.ts, features/rb.ts, features/te.ts, features/qb.ts
   - alphaEngine.ts
   - index.ts or forgeService.ts
   - routes.ts (preview route)
4) Assume I will copy-paste the files into my repo and then hook up the route in `server/routes.ts`.

Please include:
- Full file contents where possible
- Clear comments explaining any assumptions
- TODO markers where deeper data dependencies exist (e.g. if you need a field that might not exist exactly under that name)

I’ll handle environment variables and exact Drizzle imports. Focus on structure, types, and logic.
