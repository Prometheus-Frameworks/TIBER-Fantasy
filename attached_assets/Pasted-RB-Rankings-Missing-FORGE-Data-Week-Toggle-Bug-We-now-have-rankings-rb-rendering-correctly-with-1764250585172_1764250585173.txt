RB Rankings: Missing FORGE Data + Week Toggle Bug

We now have /rankings/rb rendering correctly with sandbox α, but all Forge fields are null:

{
  "rank": 1,
  "playerName": "C.McCaffrey",
  "team": "SF",
  "gamesPlayed": 11,
  "sandboxAlpha": 100,
  "forgeAlpha": null,
  "forgeRawAlpha": null,
  "delta": null,
  "trajectory": null
}


Tasks:

Wire RB FORGE data into the rankings table

Confirm the backend returns RB scores from:

GET /api/forge/batch?position=RB&season=2025&week=10

Mirror the WR pipeline:

RB sandbox endpoint should expose the same canonical ID used by FORGE (e.g. slug or canonicalId), just like WR:

If WR sandbox already returns canonicalId, do the same for RB.

On the RB rankings component:

Build a map of Forge scores by canonical ID.

Join sandbox rows to Forge rows using that ID.

For players with no Forge score:

Keep forgeAlpha = null / show — in the UI.

They must not be hidden by the “big disagreements only” filter.

Fix Week Toggle: currently changing week shows the same data

Right now, switching from week 4 → week 9 yields the same RB rankings.

Need to verify:

The season and week state values are actually being used in:

fetchForgeBatchRB → should call /api/forge/batch?position=RB&season=${season}&week=${week}

(If supported) fetchSandboxRB → /api/sandbox/rb?season=${season}&week=${week}

The useEffect (or equivalent) that triggers data fetch includes [season, week] in its dependency array so it re-runs when the toggle changes.

The backend forge service is not ignoring the week parameter for RB:

Confirm RB Forge logic uses season and week to filter weekly_stats (similar to WR).

Goal:

Changing the week on RB rankings should actually change the Forge scores (and, if applicable, sandbox stats), not just re-render the same data.

Verify RB Forge is actually computing scores

Add a temporary log or debug check in the Forge service:

When position=RB, season=2025, week=10, log how many scores are produced.

We expect non-zero RB Forge scores for 2025; if count is 0, fix the underlying query/filters.
