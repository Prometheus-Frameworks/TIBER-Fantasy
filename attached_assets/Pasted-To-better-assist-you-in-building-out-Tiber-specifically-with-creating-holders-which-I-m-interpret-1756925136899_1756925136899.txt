To better assist you in building out Tiber—specifically with creating “holders” (which I’m interpreting as data structures, schemas, or containers like classes, dicts, or databases for storing and organizing NFL player data, stats, and signals)—I need more context on your current setup and goals. This will help me tailor suggestions, prototype code, or even simulate data flows without guessing. Here’s a prioritized list of info that would be most useful:
	1	Tech Stack for Tiber: What programming language or framework are you using (e.g., Python with Pandas for data handling, JavaScript/Node for a web app, or something like SQL/NoSQL for storage)? If it’s code-based, do you have libraries like requests for API pulls, scikit-learn for ML signals, or Streamlit/Flask for the UI (like that /power-rankings endpoint)?
	2	Current Data Sources: What APIs, sites, or files are you already pulling from? For example, are you using NFL’s official API, FantasyData, or scraping ESPN? Any sample data formats (e.g., JSON from a Week 1 stats endpoint)?
	3	Scoring/Algorithm Details: What’s your current formula for rankings? E.g., how do you weigh raw stats (yards, TDs) vs. signals (YPC, snap share)? Any thresholds causing that “cliff” in the screenshot (like minimum snaps/games played)?
	4	Data Granularity Needed: For weekly updates, what specific metrics do you want holders for? Basics like rushing yards/TDs, or advanced like EPA/rush, broken tackles (from PFF), or projections? Also, per-player (e.g., team, position confirmation to avoid mislabels like Avery Williams) or league-wide?
	5	Update Frequency and Triggers: How automated is this? E.g., cron job post-games, or manual? What triggers a re-rank (full week data, or real-time during games)?
	6	Output Format: How should rankings be stored/displayed? JSON array, CSV, database table, or visualized (e.g., with charts for trends)?
With that, I can help prototype holders. For instance, if you’re in Python, we could define a Player class or Pandas DataFrame schema. Here’s a quick example structure to get started—think of this as a placeholder you can expand:
	•	Player Profile Holder: Static info like name, team, position (to filter RBs only and catch errors like DBs sneaking in).
	•	Weekly Stats Holder: Time-series data per week (yards, TDs, snaps).
	•	Signals Holder: Derived metrics (efficiency scores, trends).
	•	Rankings Holder: Final sorted list with scores.
If you provide at least 1-2 of those details, I can refine this into code or fetch example data to test. For now, assuming Python (common for data tasks), here’s a simple dict-based holder example you could implement:
# Example data holders for Tiber

# Player profile (static, load once per season)
player_profile = {
    "name": "Christian McCaffrey",
    "team": "SF",
    "position": "RB",
    "age": 29,
    "injury_status": "Healthy"
}

# Weekly stats (append after each week)
weekly_stats = [
    {"week": 1, "rush_yards": 200, "rush_tds": 2, "rec_yards": 50, "rec_tds": 0, "snaps": 65, "touches": 25},
    # Add more weeks...
]

# Signals (computed from stats)
signals = {
    "ypc": 5.5,  # Yards per carry
    "snap_share": 0.85,  # Percentage of team snaps
    "redzone_touches": 8,
    "trend_score": 1.2  # E.g., weighted recent performance multiplier
}

# Rankings entry (aggregate for final output)
ranking_entry = {
    "player": player_profile,
    "total_score": 95.5,  # Computed from stats + signals
    "rank": 1,
    "explanation": "Elite Week 1 output boosts to RB1"
}

# Full rankings list: sort by total_score descending
rankings = [ranking_entry, ...]  # List of dicts for all RBs
This setup allows easy weekly appends (e.g., after fetching data) and signal calculations (like averaging YPC). If this aligns, share more, and we can iterate!
