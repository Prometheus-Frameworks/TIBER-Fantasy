TIBER.AI — Player Profile Page Polish + Safety Pass (NO new features)

Goal:
Ensure the new /player/:playerId page is production-stable, consistent with drawer behavior, and has clean loading/error UX. Do not add new features or redesign the app.

Checklist (must complete all):

1) Route verification (Wouter)
- Confirm /player/:playerId is registered in client/src/App.tsx and does not conflict with other routes.
- Add a quick manual test note in PR summary: routes visited and expected behavior.

2) PlayerId consistency + navigation
- Ensure "View Full Profile" link in PlayerDetailDrawer uses the same playerId used in API calls (nflfastr/GSIS canonical id).
- Ensure "Back to Tiers" link navigates correctly to /tiers.

3) Defaults + guardrails
- If week/season are missing or invalid, default to:
  - season = current season already used elsewhere in app (fallback to 2025 if needed)
  - week = current week detection util if available; otherwise max available week for that player (via existing player stats endpoints).
- Clamp week between 1–18 always.

4) Loading + error UX
- Add skeletons and/or placeholder states for:
  - player identity fetch
  - tiber score fetch
  - metric matrix fetch
- If any endpoint fails, show a compact error message in that card and keep the page usable.
- Avoid layout jank: skeleton sizes should match final layout.

5) Data integrity labels
- Make sure Metric Matrix label clarifies it is “through selected week” if season mode exists.
- Do not imply season aggregation unless the backend actually aggregates.

6) Quick regression check
- Confirm PlayerSearchBar still opens the drawer correctly.
- Confirm drawer still renders and now includes the "View Full Profile" link without breaking layout.

Verification required (run and report results):
- npm run test:forge
- npm run audit:metric-matrix
- Run dev server and manually visit:
  - /player/00-0036900 (Chase)
  - /tiers then open drawer for the same player
- Provide a brief summary of what was changed and why.

Constraints:
- No new endpoints.
- No schema changes.
- No major UI redesign.
