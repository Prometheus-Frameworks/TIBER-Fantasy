STAGE 1 DELETION v1.1 (FINAL, REFINED)

We are performing Stage 1 of our service cleanup.
Delete only the files classified as LEGACY_UNUSED or DEAD_ORPHAN.

Remove these import lines before deleting the file:

import { fetchGrokProjections } from './services/grokProjectionsService';


After removing imports, delete:

🧹 3. Clean up any stray references

Search for references to deleted services. If any exist:

Remove the import

Remove or adjust any calling code

Ensure no leftover variables break builds

🛠️ 4. Build / Type-Check after deletion

Run the project’s build / type-check flow.
Fix errors caused by:

Import paths pointing to deleted files

Unused variables

Missing types

⛔️ 5. DO NOT TOUCH these in Stage 1

These stay untouched:

rankingsFusionService.ts

predictionEngine.ts

roleBankService.ts

UPHCoordinator.ts

Any ECR-related services

Any Player Identity services

Any Snap services except snapCounts.ts

These will be handled when FORGE is installed.
