You are updating the existing QB Rankings Sandbox to add TWO new lens-style presets:

1) qb_fantasy_lens_v1  – Fantasy-focused, Konami turned up, context lighter
2) qb_realball_lens_v1 – Real QB play, efficiency + context cranked, rushing treated as bonus

Do NOT:
- Do not change the 4-pillar structure (Volume, Production, Efficiency, Context).
- Do not remove or rename existing presets (Balanced, Deep Ball Hunter, Game Manager, Dual Threat, Pure Efficiency).
- Do not change the base alphaScore formula (weighted sum of the 4 pillar indices).
- Do not break export/import JSON or candidate formula saving.

You MAY:
- Add new presets to the preset list.
- Associate special behavior with those presets for how Konami boost is applied.
- Optionally slightly tweak internal Production weighting ONLY for those two lenses if done cleanly and safely.

==================================================
TASK 1 – Add two new presets
==================================================

Extend the presets list to include:

1) "Fantasy Lens v1" (id: qb_fantasy_lens_v1)
   - Intent: Fantasy-first view, Konami QBs emphasized, context slightly lighter.
   - Default weights:
        Volume:     20
        Production: 40
        Efficiency: 25
        Context:    15

2) "Real Ball Lens v1" (id: qb_realball_lens_v1)
   - Intent: Real QB quality, efficiency + context prioritized, rushing treated as a bonus only.
   - Default weights:
        Volume:     20
        Production: 20
        Efficiency: 40
        Context:    20

Implementation details:
- These must appear alongside the existing presets in the dropdown.
- When a preset is selected, the sliders should update to these values.
- Save/load/export/import logic should treat them like any other preset (no special case needed for JSON shape).

==================================================
TASK 2 – Konami behavior per lens
==================================================

Currently there is a global Konami boost applied after alphaScore is computed, something like:

  konamiBoostFactor = 1.0
  if rushFpPerGame >= 6: konamiBoostFactor = 1.10
  elif rushFpPerGame >= 4: konamiBoostFactor = 1.05

  alphaScore *= konamiBoostFactor

You must make Konami behavior **lens-aware** while keeping backward compatibility.

Add a simple mode flag (for example: konamiMode) that can be:
- "default"
- "fantasy"
- "realball"

Rules:

1) For all existing presets (Balanced, Deep Ball Hunter, Game Manager, Dual Threat, Pure Efficiency):
   - konamiMode = "default"
   - Keep the current boost (1.10 / 1.05 thresholds).

2) For "Fantasy Lens v1" (qb_fantasy_lens_v1):
   - konamiMode = "fantasy"
   - Make the Konami boost slightly stronger:

      if rushFpPerGame >= 6:
          konamiBoostFactor = 1.12
      elif rushFpPerGame >= 4:
          konamiBoostFactor = 1.06
      else:
          konamiBoostFactor = 1.0

3) For "Real Ball Lens v1" (qb_realball_lens_v1):
   - konamiMode = "realball"
   - Disable the Konami boost entirely:

      konamiBoostFactor = 1.0  // no rushing multiplier for this lens

Implementation approach:
- Store the currently selected preset ID in component state.
- Derive konamiMode from that ID.
- Apply the correct Konami behavior in the alphaScore calculation branch.

==================================================
TASK 3 – Optional subtle tweak to Production per lens
==================================================

If the productionIndex is currently using the fantasy-weighted formula:

  productionIndex =
      0.45 * fpPerGameNorm
    + 0.30 * rushFpPerGameNorm
    + 0.15 * passTDsPerGameNorm
    + 0.10 * rzTDsPerGameNorm

You may (OPTIONALLY) introduce a lens-aware internal weighting WITHOUT changing the external slider UI.

Approach (only if you can do this cleanly):

- Keep the external pillar weights as-is (Volume/Prod/Eff/Context sliders).
- Inside productionIndex, let the weighting depend on the lens:

  If preset is qb_fantasy_lens_v1:
      // rushing more important
      productionIndex =
          0.40 * fpPerGameNorm
        + 0.35 * rushFpPerGameNorm
        + 0.15 * passTDsPerGameNorm
        + 0.10 * rzTDsPerGameNorm

  If preset is qb_realball_lens_v1:
      // passing stability more important, rushing demoted
      productionIndex =
          0.50 * fpPerGameNorm
        + 0.10 * rushFpPerGameNorm
        + 0.25 * passTDsPerGameNorm
        + 0.15 * rzTDsPerGameNorm

  Else:
      // for all other presets, keep the existing shared formula

If this is too invasive for the current code structure, you may skip this step and only rely on the preset weights + Konami behavior. Do not create a mess of conditionals; keep the function clean.

==================================================
TASK 4 – UI Indicators (light touch)
==================================================

Add a subtle visual indication of which lens is active:

- When qb_fantasy_lens_v1 is selected:
    - Show a small chip or label near the sliders: "Fantasy Lens v1 (Konami emphasized)".

- When qb_realball_lens_v1 is selected:
    - Show a small chip or label: "Real Ball Lens v1 (efficiency + context)".

Do NOT clutter the UI; a single small label or helper text line is enough.

==================================================
TASK 5 – Validation
==================================================

After implementing:

1) Confirm:
   - Preset dropdown includes both new lenses.
   - Selecting either adjusts slider weights correctly.
   - Alpha scores change appropriately when switching between lenses.

2) Data behavior expectations:
   - Under qb_fantasy_lens_v1:
     - High-rush QBs (Hurts, Lamar, Fields, Dart, Jayden Daniels) rise relative to pocket passers with similar FP/G.
   - Under qb_realball_lens_v1:
     - True efficiency+context QBs (Mahomes, Maye, Dak, Stafford, Stroud if efficiency improves, etc.) dominate.
     - Fields / Dart / Daniels are still helped by their fantasy output but no longer over-inflated by Konami.

3) Ensure:
   - Context column still shows correct, varied contextIndex values.
   - Export/import JSON and candidate formula saving still function exactly as before (weights only; lens behavior is implicit in preset ID and internal logic).

Update replit.md with a short section:
- documenting qb_fantasy_lens_v1 and qb_realball_lens_v1,
- their intended use,
- and how Konami behavior differs between them.
