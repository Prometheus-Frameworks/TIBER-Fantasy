Week 1 NFL Recap (September 4-8, 2025)
The 2025 NFL season kicked off with a mix of thrilling comebacks, rookie debuts, and surprising upsets across an unusual schedule that included a Thursday opener, a Friday international game in Sao Paulo, Brazil, a packed Sunday slate, and Monday Night Football. Here’s a day-by-day breakdown of all the action, including final scores, key performances, and notable moments.
Thursday, September 4: Kickoff Game
Philadelphia Eagles 24, Dallas Cowboys 20 The defending Super Bowl champions held off a gritty Cowboys rally despite a lightning delay and the pre-game ejection of Eagles DT Jalen Carter. Jalen Hurts powered the offense with two rushing touchdowns, exploiting big lanes in the run game, while the Eagles’ defense forced a crucial third-quarter fumble from Cowboys RB Miles Sanders at the 9-yard line to preserve the lead. Dallas’ CeeDee Lamb had drops in key spots, and their offense showed flashes but couldn’t capitalize fully. Notable stats: Hurts extended his NFL record for QBs with multiple rushing TDs to 16 games; Cowboys allowed 123 rush yards in the first half but tightened up later. 20 13 21
Friday, September 5: International Game (Sao Paulo, Brazil)
Los Angeles Chargers 27, Kansas City Chiefs 21 In a stunning upset, Justin Herbert outdueled Patrick Mahomes in the NFL’s Brazil showcase. Herbert was sharp in the second half (13-of-16 for 147 yards and two TDs), including a game-sealing 19-yard scramble on third-and-14. WR Quentin Johnston starred with five catches for 79 yards and two scores. The Chiefs’ receiver depth was tested with injuries to Xavier Worthy (shoulder) and others, ending their league-record 17 straight one-score wins. Key moment: Chiefs’ blitzes sacked Herbert twice, but couldn’t stop the Chargers’ dynamic plays. 20 21
Sunday, September 7: Main Slate
Buffalo Bills 41, Baltimore Ravens 40 In the wildest game of the week, Josh Allen orchestrated a massive comeback from a 40-25 deficit, throwing for 394 yards with two passing TDs and adding two rushing scores. The turning point was DT Ed Oliver forcing a fumble from Ravens RB Derrick Henry, recovered by LB Terrel Bernard, setting up Allen’s 1-yard TD run late. Baltimore’s DeAndre Hopkins had a one-handed 29-yard TD grab, but the Ravens blew their biggest lead in the Lamar Jackson era (15+ points in the final four minutes). This marked the first such collapse since 2017. 11 20 21 14
Tampa Bay Buccaneers 23, Atlanta Falcons 20 The Bucs edged out a dramatic win thanks to rookie WR Emeka Egbuka’s two TD catches, including a 25-yarder in the final minute.

San Francisco 49ers 17, Seattle Seahawks 13 The Niners spoiled Sam Darnold’s Seahawks debut with a gritty, if sloppy, win. SF’s third-string TE grabbed the game-winner, but their pass-catchers exited with injuries. 7 10 21
Green Bay Packers 27, Detroit Lions 13 Green Bay jumped out early and cruised, handing the Lions—who had just two regular-season losses last year—one of their few defeats with a balanced attack. 15 21

Monday, September 8: Monday Night Football
Minnesota Vikings 27, Chicago Bears 24 Rookie QB J.J. McCarthy engineered a stunning fourth-quarter comeback in his debut, becoming the first QB to account for three TDs in the fourth of his first game. Minnesota overcame a double-digit deficit, aided by RB Jordan Mason’s second-half surge (68 yards on 15 carries) and two DPI calls leading to points. Chicago’s Caleb Williams started hot but faded, hurt by 12 penalties (127 yards) including four first-half false starts. McCarthy joined Steve Young as the only QBs in 45 years to pull off such a rally in a debut. 0 20 22 25
Overall, Week 1 highlighted rookie impacts (McCarthy, Daniels, Nix), veteran moves (Rodgers, Jones), and epic finishes, setting up an exciting season. Standouts included Allen’s MVP-caliber play and several close calls that went down to the wire.
