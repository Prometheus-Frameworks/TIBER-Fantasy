We’re continuing the backend cleanup for the TIBER Fantasy platform.

This is an audit-only pass — do NOT delete anything yet.
Just map, classify, and surface issues exactly like the last audit.

TARGET FILES TO AUDIT

Please audit the following backend routes:

Analytics Layer

server/routes/analyticsRoutes.ts

Any inline /api/hot-list/* handlers in server/routes.ts
(these replaced hotListLive.ts)

Redraft Layer

server/routes/redraftRoutes.ts

server/routes/redraftWeeklyRoutes.ts

Ranking/ETL Overlaps

server/routes/rankingsV3.ts

server/routes/ovrRoutes.ts

server/routes/bronzeLayerRoutes.ts

server/routes/silverLayerRoutes.ts

server/routes/goldLayerRoutes.ts

Any other ETL-related or analytics-related route modules mounted under /api/* that interact with:

weekly stats

projections

logs

usage

advanced metrics

WHAT TO DOCUMENT (for each file)

For each of the files above, please provide:

1. File Path
2. Routes Defined

List each route with method + path, e.g.:

GET /api/analytics/trends
POST /api/redraft/week/update

3. What Each Route Returns

(High-level description only)

4. Imports / Dependencies

Especially note if they rely on:

Silver Layer

Gold Layer

EPA

Sleeper

Old ETL modules

Local mocks

5. Where They Are Mounted

Find their mount blocks inside server/routes.ts.

6. Frontend Usage (search client/)

Mark each endpoint as:

USED_BY_FRONTEND (list the file)

NOT_USED

UNKNOWN (if ambiguous)

7. Classification

Assign one of the following:

CORE_ACTIVE

LEGACY_BUT_USED

LEGACY_UNUSED

DEAD/TEST_ONLY

INLINE_DUPLICATE (for /hot-list/* inline implementations)

8. Overlaps / Redundancy

Compare across analytics, redraft, rankings, bronze/silver/gold layers.

Example overlap flags:

“redraftWeeklyRoutes duplicates season stats logic in silverLayerRoutes”

“analyticsRoutes has hot-list logic already present inline in routes.ts”

“rankingsV3 and ovrRoutes overlap with enhancedRankingsRoutes (now removed)”

“ETL layers provide similar data; some routes are redundant”

OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a structured markdown report with this template:

## analyticsRoutes.ts
- Path:
- Routes:
- Returns:
- Imports:
- Mounted:
- Frontend usage:
- Classification:
- Notes:

## Inline Hot-List (routes.ts)

## redraftWeeklyRoutes.ts
...

## rankingsV3.ts
...

## ovrRoutes.ts

## bronzeLayerRoutes.ts

NOTHING SHOULD BE DELETED YET

This is strictly an audit pass.
After the report, we’ll decide which ones get removed, merged, or rebuilt.
