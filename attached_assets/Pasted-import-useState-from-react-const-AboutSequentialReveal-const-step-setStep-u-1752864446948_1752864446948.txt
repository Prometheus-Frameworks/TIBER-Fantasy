            We want to make the hard stuff simple. We build tools, apply context wherever we can, 
            and always aim to involve as many real-life fantasy players as possible.

            This project isn’t about paywalls or profit. It’s about open tools, honest insights, 
            and building something together. If you’re curious or want to help, contribute anytime. 
            Every tool we build is made better by the people who use it.

            This project is proof that ordinary people can do extraordinary things.

            If you’re reading this, you’re already part of the movement.
