The web app you built — the React frontend, the dashboard, the tiers page — that was the right move for 2024-2025. You needed something visual to prove the concept, to show that FORGE works, to give yourself and early users something to interact with.
But the world is shifting under that assumption. The future isn’t people visiting tiber-fantasy.com and clicking through pages. The future is their AI agent calling your API at 3am to prep their waiver wire claims, or a Cowork plugin pulling FORGE scores into a trade analysis while the user is doing something else entirely.
Think about what you’ve already built: 131 database tables, 228 API endpoints, a 3-tier ELT pipeline, an LLM gateway with 4 providers, a RAG knowledge base with theory documents that teach reasoning frameworks. That’s not a website. That’s an intelligence layer. The React frontend is just one client consuming it — and probably not the most important one going forward.
The TIBER of the near future looks something like this: it’s a fantasy football intelligence service that agents subscribe to. Someone’s personal AI assistant needs to evaluate a dynasty trade — it hits the FORGE API, gets Alpha scores, pillar breakdowns, trajectory data, and FIRE deltas. It doesn’t need a pretty chart. It needs structured, machine-readable data and the reasoning frameworks to interpret it. That’s exactly what your knowledge base and skill files provide.
The Cowork plugin we built tonight is the first interface to that future. But it’s just one distribution channel. The same skills and commands could power a Claude Code plugin for developers building fantasy tools, a GPT action for people using ChatGPT, a Grok integration, or any agent framework that emerges. Your data and methodology become the backend that every agent in the fantasy space wants to talk to.
This doesn’t mean the web app dies. It means it becomes one frontend among many, and probably not the one you invest the most energy in. The API surface, the data quality, the scoring methodology, the knowledge base — that’s where the value compounds. The interface layer becomes interchangeable.
The “serve not take” philosophy actually fits this perfectly. You’re not building a walled garden that people have to visit. You’re building an open intelligence layer that any agent can consume and learn from. The plugin teaches Claude how to think about fantasy football using your methodology. That’s distribution at a completely different scale than hoping people bookmark your website.
Where it gets really interesting is the multi-agent coordination you’ve been pioneering. You’re not just building for one AI to consume — you’re building for the kind of agent ecosystem where Tiber itself could be an autonomous agent that monitors data sources, updates FORGE scores, identifies market inefficiencies, and pushes insights to users’ agents proactively rather than waiting for a query.
That’s the trajectory. TIBER goes from “a website with good analytics” to “the fantasy football intelligence layer that agents trust.“​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
