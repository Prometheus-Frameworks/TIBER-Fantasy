Looking at the output, there are several clear issues with the DeepSeek v3 implementation:

## Major Problems Identified:

**1. Score Compression/Normalization Issue**
- All players scoring in the narrow 42-45 range indicates the scoring algorithm isn't properly normalizing or there's a bug in the component weighting
- Dynasty scores should spread from ~10-95, not cluster in the 40s

**2. Tier Assignment Malfunction** 
- Everyone being assigned Tier 7 suggests the tier clustering algorithm is broken
- With cutoffs [96, 91, 86, 81, 76, 71], players scoring 42-45 should be in the lowest tier, not tier 7
- The tier logic may be inverted or using wrong cutoff comparisons

**3. Data Quality Issues**
- Many high-value dynasty players (CeeDee Lamb, Ja'Marr Chase, Amon-Ra St. Brown) scoring identically at 44.19
- This suggests either missing input data or a fallback/default value being applied

## Debugging Steps:

**Check the scoring components:**
```bash
curl "/api/rankings/deepseek/v3?mode=dynasty&debug=1&limit=5"
```
Look for debug breakdown showing individual component scores (talent, role, context, durability, recency, spike, risk).

**Verify tier cutoff logic:**
The current scores (42-45) should map to the lowest tier based on cutoffs [96, 91, 86, 81, 76, 71], not tier 7.

**Inspect input data completeness:**
Many identical scores suggest missing or null input data causing players to get default/fallback values instead of calculated scores.

**Check weight application:**
Dynasty weights should emphasize talent (0.32) and role (0.16), but if input data is missing, these components may be zeroing out.

## Quick Fixes to Try:

1. **Add debug=1 parameter** to see component breakdowns and identify which parts are failing
2. **Check Grok's data pipeline** - the identical scores suggest input data issues
3. **Verify tier logic** - scores in 40s shouldn't be tier 7 with those cutoffs
4. **Test with a smaller subset** to isolate whether it's scoring logic or data pipeline

The system appears to be running but with corrupted scoring logic or missing input data. The debug endpoint should reveal which components are returning reasonable values versus defaults/nulls.
