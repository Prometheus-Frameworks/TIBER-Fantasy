Yeah, I dug into this blueprint—it's a tight, actionable setup that builds directly on what we've been hashing out. Love how it keeps things modular (e.g., data clients pluggable into OTC's existing pipes) and balances real-time freshness with weekly snapshots to avoid over-querying APIs. The DB schema nails the separation of raw signals from computed scores, and your Waiver Heat function sticks to my weighting rec without overcomplicating. Normalization examples are spot-on for avoiding outliers, and the guardrails add smart realism (like handling byes or committees). Cron timing is perfect for pre-waiver drops, and the API endpoints feel user-friendly—GET /risers?week=current for live computes is a nice touch.

A few truth-seeking flags where reality might bite, based on quick scans of current (Sept 2025) sources:

- **API Availability Gaps**: Some of the suggested providers don't have straightforward public APIs or keys as assumed.
  - FantasyLife: No public API or JSON feed I could confirm— their site is heavy on articles and tools like utilization reports, but dev access seems limited to scraping or RSS. If OTC already pulls from them, great; otherwise, pivot to Rotoworld/NBC Sports for blurbs (they have RSS feeds for player news, e.g., via RotoWire's NFL RSS). Or use RotoBaller's free XML/JSON news feeds as a backup—they cover coach quotes and role shifts well.
  - Rotoworld: Solid for news blurbs via RSS (player news feed is scrapable or RSS-pullable), but no official API. Their content is now under NBC Sports, so hook into that for injuries too.
  - FantasyPros: Great for ADP data (they update consensus ADP daily, including deltas and rookies), but no public API—more like CSV exports or site scraping. If you need programmatic access, ffscrapr (JS-friendly) or similar libs can pull it; Underdog has better real-time ADP feeds if you're okay with best-ball focus.
  - Injuries/Depth: NFL-Data-Py is Python, so for Node, you'd need a proxy (e.g., run it in a subprocess) or switch to JS equivs like nflfastjs (handles snaps, injuries) or SportsDataIO's API (paid but robust for historical depth charts).
  - Sleeper: Endpoints exist for players/stats, but snap counts/routes/targets aren't direct— you'd aggregate from weekly stats or pair with FantasyLife's utilization data. If OTC has this synced, it's fine; else, enhance sleeperClient.ts to derive from their trends or projections endpoints.

- **DB Tweaks**: Schema's clean, but add indices for perf (e.g., INDEX on weekly_usage(season, week) and riser_snapshots(created_at)). Also, consider a view or query helper to join signals for trends—makes /players/:id/trend cheaper.

- **Code Nits**: Clamp func should handle NaN (e.g., add isNaN check). In usageGrowthSignal, the divisors (10 for routes, 6 for tgts) are arbitrary—tune with real data to avoid over-penalizing low-volume rookies. Backfill job is a good include for historical testing.

- **Edge Cases**: Rookie filter assumes draft_year === season, but UDFAs might need manual flagging. For news_weight, your cap at 0.5 unless corroborated is gold—prevents hype inflating heat.

Overall, this is ready to ship with those source tweaks— it'll make Rookie Risers a beast once integrated. If Tiber's got OTC wrappers for the gappy APIs, we're golden; otherwise, let's prototype one client (say, newsClient.ts with RSS) to test. Send it, or want me to mock a quick diff?
