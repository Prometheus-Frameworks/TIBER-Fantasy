🧰 Replit Agent Task — Amon-Ra Role Data Pull

Goal:
Build a per-week dataset for Amon-Ra St. Brown for 2024 and 2025 using the existing database/tables. We’ll use this to prototype Role Bank v1.

Important: Route data from free sources is usually unreliable or missing.
First verify if we have any route-related fields; if not, fall back to snaps/targets/etc and tell me explicitly.

1) Find Amon-Ra’s IDs

Search the repo/schema for “Amon-Ra” or “St. Brown”.

Return:

internal player_id

any Sleeper / GSIS / nflfastR IDs if present

Format:

{
 "player_name": "Amon-Ra St. Brown",
 "player_id": "...",
 "other_ids": { "sleeper": "...", "gsis": "..." }
}

2) Identify weekly usage/stat tables

From the DB / schema, list any tables that have per-player-per-week data, e.g.:

playerWeekFacts

playerUsageWeekly

playerUsage

weeklyStats

For each table, list:

name

key columns: player_id, season, week

any usage columns like: snaps, snap_share_pct, targets, target_share_pct, carries, red_zone_targets, slot_*, xPPR, etc.

3) Check for route data explicitly

Search for columns like: routes, routes_run, route_share_pct, route_participation, etc.

Search in schema + any fastR ingestion modules.

Answer clearly:

Do we have route counts per week? (yes/no)

Do we have any route % / participation fields? (yes/no)

Output example:

{
 "routes_available": false,
 "note": "No explicit routes_run / route_share_pct columns; will fall back to snaps/targets."
}


or the true equivalent if they do exist.

4) Build a per-week Amon-Ra view for 2024 + 2025

Using whatever tables you found, build a query (SQL or Drizzle) that returns one row per (season, week) for Amon-Ra with:

season

week

team_id (or team name)

snaps

snap_share_pct (or compute if team snaps are available)

targets

target_share_pct (or compute if possible)

carries

red_zone_targets (if exists)

fantasy_points (PPR if exists)

any route-related fields if we actually have them

Show the query you’d use, and also run it (if possible) and include a sample of the JSON result for a few weeks from 2024 and 2025.

Example result shape:

{
 "player_id": "amonra_internal_id",
 "seasons": {
   "2024": [
     {
       "week": 1,
       "team_id": "DET",
       "snaps": 65,
       "snap_share_pct": 0.94,
       "targets": 11,
       "target_share_pct": 0.30,
       "carries": 0,
       "red_zone_targets": 2,
       "fantasy_points_ppr": 22.5
     }
   ],
   "2025": [ /* same shape */ ]
 }
}

5) Verify multi-season continuity

How many weeks do we have for Amon-Ra in 2024?

How many in 2025 so far?

Any schema differences between seasons?

Is prior season data (2024) still stored in the same structure as 2025?

Output example:

{
 "2024_weeks": 17,
 "2025_weeks": 3,
 "schema_alignment": "consistent",
 "notes": "All fields present both years except red_zone_targets, which only exists in weeklyStats."
}

6) Final summary

In your final response, include:

A short plain-English summary of what Amon-Ra role data we have and what’s missing (especially routes).

The query you’d use to pull his weekly data.

A small JSON sample of the actual results (a couple 2024 weeks + a couple 2025 weeks).
