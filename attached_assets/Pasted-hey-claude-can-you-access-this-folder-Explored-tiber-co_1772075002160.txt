can you use player eval to tell determine jamarr chases dynasty value? puka nacua and JSN have climbed to consensus WR1 and 2 respectively. could this be a potential buy *low* window for jamarr chase?

Great question to dig into. Let me run through this properly using the FORGE framework — one important caveat upfront: I don't have live access to the TIBER API endpoints right now, so I can't pull real-time Alpha scores from the database. What I can do is walk through the dynasty evaluation framework with what we know, and flag where live data would change the picture.

/tiber:player-eval Ja'Marr Chase --mode dynasty

Alpha: T1 Elite (estimated 88–93 dynasty range) Caveat: live recursion pass would refine this — trajectory data matters here

Pillar Breakdown

Volume — Strong (est. 88–92) Chase's target share and route participation have been elite since his rookie year. The Burrow-Chase connection is one of the most reliable QB-to-WR pipelines in the league — not just usage, but quality of usage (contested targets, end zone looks, route priority). If the Bengals' offense is healthy, his volume floor is as high as any WR in the game.

Efficiency — Elite (est. 90+) This is the pillar that separates Chase from a lot of "high volume" WRs. His FPOE and yards-per-route-run have consistently been top-3 at the position. He creates separation cleanly and converts opportunity at an elite rate. FORGE would weight this heavily in dynasty mode.

Team Context — Strong, with a flag (est. 78–84) The Burrow dependency is real. When Burrow is healthy, this pillar is borderline elite. But Cincinnati's OL and Burrow's injury history create some suppression here. FORGE dynasty mode would dock Team Context for that fragility — not enough to drop him out of T1, but it's the pillar to watch.

Stability — Strong (est. 80–85) Chase has generally been durable, but there have been weeks where his role compresses (usage spikes TD-heavily in some stretches). A Football Lens scan would be worth running here — if a meaningful chunk of his fantasy scoring is TD-dependent, that's a sustainability flag even for an elite player.

Football Lens Check Worth pulling forgeFootballLens.ts data here. Chase has had seasons where his TD rate outpaces his pure volume/efficiency story. If his Football Lens is clean → pure dynasty hold. If there's a TD-spike flag active → the "buy low" case is slightly more complicated, because part of what you're buying is regression-to-sustainable rather than regression-to-boom.

On the Puka Nacua / JSN Question

This is exactly the kind of market inefficiency TIBER is built to surface. Let's think through it:

The market signal: Puka and JSN climbing to consensus WR1/WR2 in dynasty rankings represents a recency-bias shift. Both are younger, cheaper, and had visibility-heavy 2025 performances. The market is rotating capital toward them.

What FORGE would say: Age curve matters enormously in dynasty mode. Chase is 26 — he's in his peak efficiency window right now, not approaching it. Puka (24) and JSN (23) have age in their favor, but neither has Chase's established efficiency ceiling or the proven QB connection. FORGE dynasty mode explicitly weights Stability and Team Context higher — Chase's proven Burrow connection scores better than either of those two on Team Context until proven otherwise.

The buy-low case is real if: Chase's market value (trade cost in dynasty leagues) has materially dropped because managers are chasing Puka/JSN youth. If you can acquire Chase at a WR2/3 price while FORGE still has him T1 in dynasty mode, that's a textbook market inefficiency — FORGE Alpha hasn't moved with the market narrative.

What could break it: A Burrow long-term health concern, a Bengals offensive overhaul, or a Chase efficiency dip that shows up in the FIRE-adjacent efficiency signals (FPOE turning negative). Those would be legitimate reasons the market is pricing him down, not just recency bias.

Recommendation: Conditional Buy-Low — HIGH confidence the window is real

The case for acquiring Chase at a discount is strong if the discount is driven by Puka/JSN hype rather than Chase-specific signal deterioration. Before pulling the trigger, I'd want to check:

Is his Football Lens clean or is there a TD-spike flag?
What does the trajectory endpoint show — stable T1 or gradual decline over the last 6–8 weeks of the season?
Any Bengals offseason moves that affect Team Context (OL, offensive coordinator stability)?
If those checks come back clean, this is a buy. You're getting a proven T1 dynasty asset at a market discount driven by narrative, not data.

Want me to also run /tiber:buy-sell --position WR --mode dynasty to see where Chase lands against the broader field? Or cross-check Puka/JSN directly to see if their FORGE profiles actually justify the market premium?

yes claude go ahead and run /tiber:buy-sell --position WR --mode dynasty

if you dont mind, id like to document this conversation. TIBER is a project of mine, and this is my first run at using claude co work (familiar with claude and claude code). this isnt a test

Love the context — and welcome to Cowork. Let's run it, and we can talk documentation right after.

/tiber:buy-sell --position WR --mode dynasty --limit 6

Note: live Alpha scores not available without API connection — analysis grounded in FORGE framework + current market signals

📈 BUY LOW

1. Ja'Marr Chase (est. α89–93, T1 Elite) Already broke this down, but he belongs at the top of this list. If the Puka/JSN consensus surge has depressed Chase's trade cost in your league, FORGE dynasty pillars don't move with narrative — his efficiency ceiling and Burrow connection are intact. This is the clearest market inefficiency on the board. Buy at WR2 price, hold a WR1.

2. Davante Adams (est. α68–74, T2→T3 depending on situation) The market has fully written off Adams based on age (33) and the Raiders era, but his efficiency pillar has been elite for a decade. If he lands on a competent offense with a real QB in 2026 (this is an offseason — situation TBD), his FORGE Team Context pillar snaps back hard. Classic buy-low on situation, not player. Football Lens would want to check TD-dependency, but his route running efficiency is legit. High variance, high ceiling if the landing spot works.

3. Rashee Rice (est. α72–78, T2 Strong) If Rice is still discounted from injury concern going into 2026, that's a buying window. His efficiency metrics before the injury were borderline elite — FPOE positive, target quality high, Chiefs scheme fits him perfectly. Mahomes as QB context alone pushes his Team Context pillar to near-max. Age curve (24) is fully intact. The market tends to overcorrect on injury recency. FORGE trajectory endpoint would be the key check here — if his Alpha was climbing before injury, this is a buy.

📉 SELL HIGH

1. Puka Nacua (est. α79–84, T2 Strong) This one's uncomfortable but honest: Puka being consensus WR1 in dynasty is a market signal worth questioning, not celebrating. His efficiency numbers are real — he's not a fluke. But the Volume pillar is partly driven by target opportunity in a Cooper Kupp-lite situation, and his FORGE Stability pillar has a genuine question mark around target share durability as Kupp's role evolves. The market is pricing him as a locked-in alpha with a T1 efficiency ceiling. FORGE would want to see 2+ more seasons of this before assigning T1 dynasty Alpha. If you can sell at consensus WR1 price, you're likely selling above FORGE fair value.

2. Jaxon Smith-Njigba (est. α76–82, T2 Strong) JSN's situation is compelling — young, Seahawks target leader, obvious talent. But consensus WR2 in dynasty is a steep price for a player whose efficiency metrics are still developing and whose Team Context (Seattle QB situation) has real uncertainty. His Football Lens would likely show a mixed picture: good volume, efficiency still ramping, team context suppressed. If you can sell at the peak of the "he's arrived" narrative, you're capturing maximum market value before FORGE data either validates or doesn't. This is a "sell to lock in gains, not because he's bad" move.

3. Stefon Diggs / veteran recency holds Any aging WR (30+) whose market value is being propped up by a strong 2025 finish should be scrutinized. FORGE dynasty mode hammers age curve and Stability pillar degradation hard. If you're holding a 31-year-old WR with a T2 Alpha that the market still sees as T1 because of recent volume, the sell window is now. The trajectory endpoint would likely show a slow decline that hasn't hit the market price yet.

The Through-Line

The clearest pattern in this board: the market has rotated hard toward young WRs (Puka, JSN) and away from proven ones (Chase, potentially Rice). FORGE dynasty mode doesn't move that fast. Proven efficiency + elite QB context + age < 28 = hold or buy. Unproven efficiency + compelling narrative + age 22–24 = market premium that may not be supported by Alpha yet.

The trade you should be trying to make: Chase for Puka or JSN straight up, or with additional compensation your way.
