# Joseph's Draft Analysis - Live Session
**Date**: August 14, 2025
**Team**: H4MMER
**Format**: PPR
**Platform**: OTC Analysis Complete

## Pre-Draft Strategy (Documented)
- Turn strategy: Two first-round caliber players
- Conviction players: Hunter, Maye, McConkey, Hampton
- Smart handcuffs: Mason, Davis, Charbonnet
- Avoid overpriced TD regression candidates (e.g., Terry McLaurin)

## Draft Results - REAL vs MOCK DIFFERENCES
**Key Observation**: "Real drafts tend to go a lot differently than mock drafts"

### Final Roster (Team H4MMER)
1. **QB**: Empty (Strategy pivot - waited on QB)
2. **RB1**: Saquon Barkley (PHI) - Pick 1.4
3. **RB2**: Chuba Hubbard (CAR) - Pick 5.4  
4. **WR1**: Nico Collins (HOU) - Pick 2.7
5. **WR2**: Ladd McConkey (LAC) - Pick 3.4 ✅ **CONVICTION HIT**
6. **TE**: Trey McBride (ARI) - Pick 4.7
7. **FLEX**: Empty
8. **BENCH**: Empty spots showing

## Key Lessons - REAL DRAFT INSIGHTS
1. **Turn Strategy Abandoned**: Got Saquon at 1.4 (not 1.10-1.12) - draft flow changed strategy
2. **Conviction Player Success**: McConkey hit at 3.4 - pre-draft film work paid off
3. **QB Strategy Pivot**: Completely avoided QB in shown picks - major strategic shift
4. **Value vs. Conviction Balance**: Mixed approaches across positions
5. **Real Draft Chaos**: Board fell differently than mocks, required real-time adaptation

## Strategic Analysis
- **Pick 1.4 Saquon**: Premium RB when available vs. turn strategy
- **Pick 2.7 Nico Collins**: Value WR pick, HOU ascending offense  
- **Pick 3.4 McConkey**: CONVICTION target hit - rookie WR with LAC opportunity
- **Pick 4.7 McBride**: TE value vs. waiting on position
- **Pick 5.4 Hubbard**: Potential handcuff/value play (CAR backfield)

## Draft Flow Adaptation
Real drafts require abandoning mock strategies when value presents itself. Joseph pivoted from turn strategy to take elite RB at 1.4, showing tactical flexibility over rigid adherence to pre-draft plans.
