# Dynasty Weighting System - Complete Breakdown

## How We Score Josh Allen and All Players

### Current Dynasty Scoring Formula (Applied to ALL Players):

**For QBs (like Josh Allen):**
- **Production: 40%** - Current fantasy points per game (most important)
- **Opportunity: 25%** - Starting role and offensive volume 
- **Age: 20%** - Career stage and longevity projection
- **Stability: 15%** - Health, consistency, team context
- **Efficiency: 0%** - Advanced metrics (minimal weight due to research)

**For RBs:**
- **Production: 45%** - Current fantasy performance (highest weight)
- **Opportunity: 30%** - Touch share and workload
- **Age: 15%** - Age cliff considerations
- **Stability: 10%** - Injury risk factors
- **Efficiency: 0%** - YAC/efficiency less predictive than volume

**For WRs and TEs:**
- **Production: 40%** - Current fantasy points per game
- **Opportunity: 30%** - Target share (most predictive metric)
- **Age: 15%** - Career longevity factor
- **Stability: 15%** - Health and team context
- **Efficiency: 0%** - YPRR more descriptive than predictive

## Josh Allen Example Calculation:

### Raw Component Scores (0-100):
- **Production Score: 95** (Elite 23.4 PPG performance)
- **Opportunity Score: 90** (Starting QB with high pass volume)
- **Age Score: 85** (28 years old, in prime window)
- **Stability Score: 90** (Healthy, stable team/offense)
- **Efficiency Score: 80** (Good but gets 0% weight anyway)

### Weighted Calculation:
- Production: 95 × 0.40 = **38.0 points**
- Opportunity: 90 × 0.25 = **22.5 points**
- Age: 85 × 0.20 = **17.0 points**
- Stability: 90 × 0.15 = **13.5 points**
- Efficiency: 80 × 0.00 = **0.0 points**

**Raw Dynasty Value: 91 points**
**Elite Player Bonus: +7 points**
**Final Dynasty Score: 98/100**

## Research-Based Methodology:

Our weighting system is based on correlation studies showing:
1. **Production** (fantasy points) has the highest correlation with future success
2. **Opportunity** (target share, touches) is the most predictive volume metric
3. **Age** matters but shouldn't overpower proven production
4. **Efficiency** metrics (YPRR, YAC) are more descriptive than predictive
5. **Elite players** deserve exponential scaling (like KTC rankings)

## Applied to All Player Types:

### Elite Players (90+ raw score):
- Get +7 to +10 bonus points for scarcity value
- Examples: Josh Allen (98), Justin Jefferson (96), CMC (95)

### Premium Players (80-89 raw score):
- Get +2 to +5 bonus points
- Examples: Lamar Jackson (87), CeeDee Lamb (85)

### Solid Players (70-79 raw score):
- No bonus, raw score stands
- Examples: Most startable players

### Lower Tiers (<70 raw score):
- Dynasty bench/depth players
- Limited future value

## Why This System Works:

1. **Prioritizes Proven Production** - Current fantasy performance predicts future success better than projections
2. **Values Opportunity Over Efficiency** - Target share correlates 0.8+ with fantasy success; YPRR only 0.3+
3. **Balanced Age Consideration** - Doesn't over-penalize proven producers in their prime
4. **Position-Specific Logic** - QBs valued differently than RBs due to career length differences
5. **Elite Player Premium** - Top assets get scarcity bonuses like real dynasty markets

This methodology is applied consistently to all 300+ players in our database, ensuring fair and research-backed dynasty valuations.
