# TIBER Pre-Post Checklist

If a post doesn't pass this, it doesn't go live.

---

## 1. Does This Show Intelligence — Not Opinion?

Before posting, ask:
- Is this engine output or just my take?
- Can this be traced to FORGE / FIRE / CATALYST / Data Lab?
- If someone challenges it, can I show the mechanism?

If it's just: *"I think Player X breaks out"* → Don't post it.

If it's:
```
FORGE: 91 Alpha
FIRE: 63 Market Rank
Efficiency percentile: 94
Volume percentile: 48
```
Now you're talking.

---

## 2. Is the Mechanism Visible?

Every serious post should answer at least one of:
- What pillar drove this?
- What metric triggered the signal?
- What delta exists vs market?
- What changed week over week?
- What constraint exists in the model?

**Weak:** "Engine loves him."

**Strong:**
```
Efficiency pillar +21 over positional mean
Stability flag raised due to role volatility
Net Alpha +14 over market expectation
```

You're not selling magic. You're showing structure.

---

## 3. Is This Repeatable?

If someone followed you for 3 months, would they see:
- A coherent system
- A consistent framework
- Repeating visual language
- Standardized score formats

Or would they see random posts?

Before posting ask: **Does this reinforce the TIBER framework?** If not, it's noise.

---

## 4. Are You Over-Claiming?

You **cannot** say:
- "This WILL happen."
- "League winner."
- "Lock."

You **can** say:
- "Model suggests."
- "Engine sees insulation."
- "Delta vs market: +18."
- "Risk flag triggered."

**Precision > hype.**

---

## 5. Does This Attract Builders or Casuals?

Read your draft and ask: *Who does this attract?*

If it attracts:
- "Who should I start???"
- "Drop my roster?"

→ You positioned it wrong.

If it attracts:
- "How are you weighting stability?"
- "What's your efficiency calculation?"
- "Is that smoothed or raw?"

→ Perfect.

---

## 6. Is The Visual Clean and Consistent?

Before posting any image:
- Same color palette?
- Same font scale?
- Alpha clearly visible?
- Percentiles readable?
- No clutter?

TIBER should look like a lab output, not a Canva template.

Consistency builds perceived legitimacy.

---

## 7. Does This Advance The Narrative?

Every post should push one of these themes:
- Football intelligence ≠ market price
- Open intelligence layer
- Agent-compatible outputs
- Architecture transparency
- Measurable deltas
- System evolution

If it doesn't push one of those, ask why it exists.

---

## 8. Is This Worth Being Pinned in 6 Months?

If someone new visits the profile 6 months from now and scrolls back, does this post still:
- Demonstrate capability?
- Represent the system accurately?
- Reflect your long-term direction?

If it's time-sensitive fluff, it belongs in replies — not main feed.

---

## 9. Are You Posting Because It's Ready — or Because It's Quiet?

You don't need daily output yet. Infrastructure brands can post:
- 3 times per week
- With depth

**Silence is better than dilution.**

---

## 10. Final Filter: The "Infrastructure Test"

Read your post out loud and replace "TIBER" with: **"Open intelligence layer."**

If it still makes sense → it passes.

If it sounds like a fantasy influencer account → rewrite.
